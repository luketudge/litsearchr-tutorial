TI  - Efficacy of treatments for anxiety disorders: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 183-92
LID - 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000078 [doi]
AB  - To our knowledge, no previous meta-analysis has attempted to compare the efficacy of 
      pharmacological, psychological and combined treatments for the three main anxiety 
      disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia). Pre-post 
      and treated versus control effect sizes (ES) were calculated for all evaluable 
      randomized-controlled studies (n = 234), involving 37,333 patients. Medications were 
      associated with a significantly higher average pre-post ES [Cohen's d = 2.02 
      (1.90-2.15); 28,051 patients] than psychotherapies [1.22 (1.14-1.30); 6992 patients; 
      P < 0.0001]. ES were 2.25 for serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (n = 23 
      study arms), 2.15 for benzodiazepines (n = 42), 2.09 for selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (n = 62) and 1.83 for tricyclic antidepressants (n = 15). ES for 
      psychotherapies were mindfulness therapies, 1.56 (n = 4); relaxation, 1.36 (n = 17); 
      individual cognitive behavioural/exposure therapy (CBT), 1.30 (n = 93); group CBT, 
      1.22 (n = 18); psychodynamic therapy 1.17 (n = 5); therapies without face-to-face 
      contact (e.g. Internet therapies), 1.11 (n = 34); eye movement desensitization 
      reprocessing, 1.03 (n = 3); and interpersonal therapy 0.78 (n = 4). The ES was 2.12 
      (n = 16) for CBT/drug combinations. Exercise had an ES of 1.23 (n = 3). For control 
      groups, ES were 1.29 for placebo pills (n = 111), 0.83 for psychological placebos (n 
      = 16) and 0.20 for waitlists (n = 50). In direct comparisons with control groups, 
      all investigated drugs, except for citalopram, opipramol and moclobemide, were 
      significantly more effective than placebo. Individual CBT was more effective than 
      waiting list, psychological placebo and pill placebo. When looking at the average 
      pre-post ES, medications were more effective than psychotherapies. Pre-post ES for 
      psychotherapies did not differ from pill placebos; this finding cannot be explained 
      by heterogeneity, publication bias or allegiance effects. However, the decision on 
      whether to choose psychotherapy, medications or a combination of the two should be 
      left to the patient as drugs may have side effects, interactions and 
      contraindications.

TI  - British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of 
      inflammatory bowel disease in adults.
PG  - s1-s106
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2019-318484 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the principal forms of inflammatory bowel 
      disease. Both represent chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which 
      displays heterogeneity in inflammatory and symptomatic burden between patients and 
      within individuals over time. Optimal management relies on understanding and 
      tailoring evidence-based interventions by clinicians in partnership with patients. 
      This guideline for management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults over 16 years 
      of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of 
      Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and 
      Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British 
      Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians 
      (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal 
      and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for 
      Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn's and Colitis UK). A systematic review of 
      88 247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary 
      clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert 
      opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical 
      interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both 
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is 
      provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive 
      therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as 
      well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between 
      primary and secondary care. Twenty research priorities to inform future clinical 
      management are presented, alongside objective measurement of priority importance, 
      determined by 2379 electronic survey responses from individuals living with 
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, including patients, their families and 
      friends.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety and related disorders: A meta-analysis of 
      randomized placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 502-514
LID - 10.1002/da.22728 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) for anxiety-related disorders based on randomized placebo-controlled 
      trials. We included 41 studies that randomly assigned patients (N = 2,843) with 
      acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive compulsive 
      disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD) to CBT or a psychological or pill placebo condition. Findings 
      demonstrated moderate placebo-controlled effects of CBT on target disorder symptoms 
      (Hedges' g = 0.56), and small to moderate effects on other anxiety symptoms (Hedges' 
      g = 0.38), depression (Hedges' g = 0.31), and quality of life (Hedges' g = 0.30). 
      Response rates in CBT compared to placebo were associated with an odds ratio of 
      2.97. Effects on the target disorder were significantly stronger for completer 
      samples than intent-to-treat samples, and for individuals compared to group CBT in 
      SAD and PTSD studies. Large effect sizes were found for OCD, GAD, and acute stress 
      disorder, and small to moderate effect sizes were found for PTSD, SAD, and PD. In 
      PTSD studies, dropout rates were greater in CBT (29.0%) compared to placebo (17.2%), 
      but no difference in dropout was found across other disorders. Interventions 
      primarily using exposure strategies had larger effect sizes than those using 
      cognitive or cognitive and behavioral techniques, though this difference did not 
      reach significance. Findings demonstrate that CBT is a moderately efficacious 
      treatment for anxiety disorders when compared to placebo. More effective treatments 
      are especially needed for PTSD, SAD, and PD.

AB  - Anxiety disorders belong to the most frequent psychiatric disorders according to 
      epidemiological studies and are associated with a high economic burden. Panic 
      disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia 
      belong to the most important clinical disorders. The etiology is complex, including 
      genetic, neurobiological as well as psychosocial factors. With regard to treatment, 
      both psychotherapy and medication can be employed according to current treatment 
      guidelines. With regard to psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      represents the treatment of choice. As for pharmacological treatment, in particular 
      modern antidepressants and pregabalin are recommended. However, several 
      recommendations have to be considered in daily clinical practice.

AB  - Recent advances in the developmental epidemiology, neurobiology, and treatment of 
      pediatric anxiety disorders have increased our understanding of these conditions and 
      herald improved outcomes for affected children and adolescents. This article reviews 
      the current epidemiology, longitudinal trajectory, and neurobiology of anxiety 
      disorders in youth. Additionally, we summarize the current evidence for both 
      psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatments of fear-based anxiety disorders 
      (e.g., generalized, social, and separation anxiety disorders) in children and 
      adolescents. Current data suggest that these disorders begin in childhood and 
      adolescence, exhibit homotypic continuity, and increase the risk of secondary 
      anxiety and mood disorders. Psychopharmacologic trials involving selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSNRIs) are effective in pediatric patients with anxiety disorders and 
      have generally demonstrated moderate effect sizes. Additionally, current data 
      support cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of these conditions in 
      youth and suggest that the combination of psychotherapy + an SSRI may be associated 
      with greater improvement than would be expected with either treatment as 
      monotherapy.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and 
      Pharmacotherapy for Childhood Anxiety Disorders: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1049-1056
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.3036 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Childhood anxiety is common. Multiple treatment options are available, 
      but existing guidelines provide inconsistent advice on which treatment to use. 
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and adverse events of 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy for childhood anxiety 
      disorders. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and SciVerse 
      Scopus from database inception through February 1, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized 
      and nonrandomized comparative studies that enrolled children and adolescents with 
      confirmed diagnoses of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, 
      generalized anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety and who received CBT, 
      pharmacotherapy, or the combination. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Independent 
      reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Random-effects meta-analysis was used 
      to pool data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary anxiety symptoms (measured by 
      child, parent, or clinician), remission, response, and adverse events. RESULTS: A 
      total of 7719 patients were included from 115 studies. Of these, 4290 (55.6%) were 
      female, and the mean (range) age was 9.2 (5.4-16.1) years. Compared with pill 
      placebo, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) significantly reduced 
      primary anxiety symptoms and increased remission (relative risk, 2.04; 95% CI, 
      1.37-3.04) and response (relative risk, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.60-2.40). 
      Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) significantly reduced 
      clinician-reported primary anxiety symptoms. Benzodiazepines and tricyclics were not 
      found to significantly reduce anxiety symptoms. When CBT was compared with 
      wait-listing/no treatment, CBT significantly improved primary anxiety symptoms, 
      remission, and response. Cognitive behavioral therapy reduced primary anxiety 
      symptoms more than fluoxetine and improved remission more than sertraline. The 
      combination of sertraline and CBT significantly reduced clinician-reported primary 
      anxiety symptoms and response more than either treatment alone. Head-to-head 
      comparisons were sparse, and network meta-analysis estimates were imprecise. Adverse 
      events were common with medications but not with CBT and were not severe. Studies 
      were too small or too short to assess suicidality with SSRIs or SNRIs. One trial 
      showed a statistically nonsignificant increase in suicidal ideation with 
      venlafaxine. Cognitive behavioral therapy was associated with fewer dropouts than 
      pill placebo or medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Evidence supports the 
      effectiveness of CBT and SSRIs for reducing childhood anxiety symptoms. 
      Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors also appear to be effective based on 
      less consistent evidence. Head-to-head comparisons between various medications and 
      comparisons with CBT represent a need for research in the field.

TI  - Dismantling cognitive-behaviour therapy for panic disorder: a systematic review and 
      component network meta-analysis.
PG  - 1945-1953
LID - 10.1017/S0033291717003919 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) for panic disorder may consist of different 
      combinations of several therapeutic components such as relaxation, breathing 
      retraining, cognitive restructuring, interoceptive exposure and/or in vivo exposure. 
      It is therefore important both theoretically and clinically to examine whether 
      specific components of CBT or their combinations are superior to others in the 
      treatment of panic disorder. Component network meta-analysis (NMA) is an extension 
      of standard NMA that can be used to disentangle the treatment effects of different 
      components included in composite interventions. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      PsycINFO and Cochrane Central, with supplementary searches of reference lists and 
      clinical trial registries, for all randomized controlled trials comparing different 
      CBT-based psychological therapies for panic disorder with each other or with control 
      interventions. We applied component NMA to disentangle the treatment effects of 
      different components included in these interventions. After reviewing 2526 
      references, we included 72 studies with 4064 participants. Interoceptive exposure 
      and face-to-face setting were associated with better treatment efficacy and 
      acceptability. Muscle relaxation and virtual-reality exposure were associated with 
      significantly lower efficacy. Components such as breathing retraining and in vivo 
      exposure appeared to improve treatment acceptability while having small effects on 
      efficacy. The comparison of the most v. the least efficacious combination, both of 
      which may be provided as 'evidence-based CBT,' yielded an odds ratio for the 
      remission of 7.69 (95% credible interval: 1.75 to 33.33). Effective CBT packages for 
      panic disorder would include face-to-face and interoceptive exposure components, 
      while excluding muscle relaxation and virtual-reality exposure.

TI  - Evaluation and Treatment of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) in 
      Adolescents.
PG  - 107-113
LID - 10.1007/s40124-018-0162-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) was added to 
      the psychiatric nomenclature in 2013. However, youth with ARFID often present first 
      to medical- rather than psychiatric-settings, making its evaluation and treatment 
      relevant to pediatricians. RECENT FINDINGS: ARFID is defined by limited volume or 
      variety of food intake motivated by sensory sensitivity, fear of aversive 
      consequences, or lack of interest in food or eating, and associated with medical, 
      nutritional, and/or psychosocial impairment. It appears to be as common as anorexia 
      nervosa and bulimia nervosa and can occur in individuals of all ages. ARFID is 
      heterogeneous in presentation and may require both medical and psychological 
      management. SUMMARY: Pediatricians should be aware of the diagnostic criteria for 
      ARFID and the possibility that these patients may require medical intervention and 
      referral for psychological treatment. The neurobiology underlying ARFID is unknown, 
      and novel treatments are currently being tested.

TI  - Basomedial amygdala mediates top-down control of anxiety and fear.
PG  - 179-85
LID - 10.1038/nature15698 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety-related conditions are among the most difficult neuropsychiatric diseases to 
      treat pharmacologically, but respond to cognitive therapies. There has therefore 
      been interest in identifying relevant top-down pathways from cognitive control 
      regions in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Identification of such pathways could 
      contribute to our understanding of the cognitive regulation of affect, and provide 
      pathways for intervention. Previous studies have suggested that dorsal and ventral 
      mPFC subregions exert opposing effects on fear, as do subregions of other 
      structures. However, precise causal targets for top-down connections among these 
      diverse possibilities have not been established. Here we show that the basomedial 
      amygdala (BMA) represents the major target of ventral mPFC in amygdala in mice. 
      Moreover, BMA neurons differentiate safe and aversive environments, and BMA 
      activation decreases fear-related freezing and high-anxiety states. Lastly, we show 
      that the ventral mPFC-BMA projection implements top-down control of anxiety state 
      and learned freezing, both at baseline and in stress-induced anxiety, defining a 
      broadly relevant new top-down behavioural regulation pathway.

TI  - Exercise for anxiety disorders: systematic review.
PG  - 187-96
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are commonly treated with antidepressants and 
      psychological treatments. Some patients may prefer alternative approaches such as 
      exercise. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the treatment effects of exercise compared with 
      other treatments for anxiety disorders. DATA SOURCES: Randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of exercise interventions for anxiety disorders were identified by searching 
      six online databases (July 2011). A number of journals were also hand searched. MAIN 
      RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included. For panic disorder: exercise appears to reduce 
      anxiety symptoms but it is less effective than antidepressant medication (1 RCT); 
      exercise combined with antidepressant medication improves the Clinical Global 
      Impression outcomes (1 RCT, p<0.05); exercise combined with occupational therapy and 
      lifestyle changes reduces Beck Anxiety Inventory outcomes (1 RCT, p=0.0002). For 
      social phobias, added benefits of exercise when combined with group cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) were shown (p<0.05). There was no significant difference 
      between aerobic and anaerobic exercise groups (1 RCT, p>0.1) with both seeming to 
      reduce anxiety symptoms (1 RCT, p<0.001). It remains unclear as to which type of 
      exercise; moderate to hard or very light to light, is more effective in anxiety 
      reduction (2 RCTs). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise seems to be effective as an adjunctive 
      treatment for anxiety disorders but it is less effective compared with 
      antidepressant treatment. Both aerobic and non-aerobic exercise seems to reduce 
      anxiety symptoms. Social phobics may benefit from exercise when combined with group 
      CBT. Further well-conducted RCTs are needed.

PG  - 1179-1189
LID - 10.1080/14737175.2019.1666713 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Classical well-established treatments of social anxiety disorder (SAD) 
      are now complemented by more recent therapeutic strategies. This review aims to 
      summarize available therapies for SAD and discuss recent evidence-based findings on 
      the management of this disorder.Areas covered: Recent guidelines recommend 
      psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and pharmacotherapy, 
      as first-line treatments of patients with SAD, without a clear superiority of one 
      option over the other. CBT includes classical approaches such as in vivo exposure to 
      social situations and cognitive therapy, but new modalities and techniques have been 
      recently developed: third-wave approaches, internet-delivered therapy, virtual 
      reality exposure, and cognitive bias modification. Selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have been also 
      extensively studied and shown to be effective in SAD. Two alternative strategies 
      have been developed to treat SAD with disappointing results: cognitive bias 
      modification, and pharmacological augmentation of psychotherapy using D-cycloserine 
      during exposure sessions.Expert opinion: Personalized treatments for SAD patients 
      are now available. Innovative strategies such as online psychotherapy and virtual 
      reality exposure are useful alternatives to CBT and SSRIs. Future developments and 
      optimization of attention bias modification and of pharmacological augmentation of 
      psychotherapy can be promising.

      Issues.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1007/s11920-019-1010-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper seeks to identify the risk factors of fear of 
      childbirth (FOC) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to birth and 
      reviews the efficacy of their respective screening tools and therapeutic 
      interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Biofeedback, hypnosis, internet-based cognitive 
      behavioral therapy, and antenatal education are promising treatments for FOC. 
      Training midwives to address traumatic birth experiences could help in preventing 
      PTSD. A shorter more pragmatic screening tool for FOC than the Wijma Delivery 
      Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (WDEQ) is needed. Women with PTSD attributed a 
      mismatch between the expected mode of delivery (MOD) and the actual MOD as the cause 
      of their trauma. A history of mental health disorders, lack of social support, 
      previous negative birth experiences, and MOD are correlated to FOC and postpartum 
      PTSD. Psycho-education and CBT-based treatments have been found to reduce levels of 
      FOC and PTSD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is not known whether common anxiety/mood comorbidities of panic 
      disorder (PD) improve with panic-focused psychological treatment, nor whether there 
      is differential efficacy between therapies in treating comorbidities. METHODS: In a 
      randomized controlled trial for PD with and without agoraphobia comparing 
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy 
      (PFPP), symptomatic comorbidities of agoraphobia, MDD, GAD, and social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD) were assessed pre-to-post treatment with the Anxiety Disorders 
      Interview Schedule (ADIS). Comparative efficacy of CBT versus PFPP for treating 
      comorbid disorders was tested at termination and 1 year's follow-up. Covariance 
      between panic and comorbidity improvements was also analyzed. RESULTS: Most 
      treatment completers (n = 120) evidenced diagnostic remission of their comorbidity 
      (range = 54-69%), which typically reflected a subclinical score on the ADIS (mean 
      range = 1.3 to 1.8). These improvements were generally retained at follow-up. 
      However, patients with MDD dropped out significantly more often (HR = 2.79). No 
      significant symptom change or remission differences emerged between CBT and PFPP for 
      any comorbidity at termination or at follow-up. Panic change was strongly related to 
      improvements in agoraphobia (r = 0.70) and MDD (r = 0.53), moderately related for 
      GAD (r = 0.31), and not significantly related for SAD (r = 0.20). DISCUSSION: 
      Patients completing panic-focused psychotherapies often experience meaningful 
      remission for diagnoses of agoraphobia, MDD, GAD, and SAD, with no detectable 
      differences between treatments, although sample sizes for the MDD and SAD 
      comparisons were small. In addition, additional efforts may be needed to keep 
      MDD-comorbid patients in treatment.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy for postpartum panic disorder: a case series.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/s40359-019-0330-z [doi]
LID - 53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical anxiety is common during the perinatal period, and anxiety 
      symptoms often persist after childbirth. Ten to 30 % of perinatal women are 
      diagnosed with panic disorder (PD)-far more than the 1.5-3% rate among the general 
      population. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been determined to be an 
      effective treatment for PD, few studies have been conducted on CBT effectiveness in 
      treating postpartum PD and, to the best of the knowledge of the present authors, no 
      research has been conducted on postpartum PD among Japanese women. In this 
      manuscript, we report on our administration of CBT to three postpartum patients with 
      PD, detailing the improvement in their symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: All patients in 
      this study were married, in their thirties, and diagnosed using the 
      Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview as having PD with agoraphobia. The 
      Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) was used to evaluate patients' panic symptoms 
      and their severity. All patients received a total of 16 weekly 50-min sessions of 
      CBT, and all completed the treatment. All patients were exceedingly preoccupied with 
      the perception that a "mother must protect her child," which reinforced the fear 
      that "the continuation of their perinatal symptoms would prevent them from rearing 
      their children". After treatment, all participants' panic symptoms were found to 
      have decreased according to the PDSS, and two no longer met clinical criteria: 
      Chihiro's score changed from 13 to 3, Beth's PDSS score at baseline from 22 to 6, 
      and Tammy's score changed from 7 to 1. CONCLUSIONS: CBT provides a therapeutic 
      effect and is a feasible method for treating postpartum PD. It is important that 
      therapists prescribe tasks that patients can perform collaboratively with their 
      children.

TI  - Is glutamate associated with fear extinction and cognitive behavior therapy outcome 
      in OCD? A pilot study.
LID - 10.1007/s00406-019-01056-3 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure and response prevention is a 
      well-established treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and is based on 
      the principles of fear extinction. Fear extinction is linked to structural and 
      functional variability in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and has been 
      consistently associated with glutamate neurotransmission. The relationship between 
      vmPFC glutamate and fear extinction and its effects on CBT outcome have not yet been 
      explored in adults with OCD. We assessed glutamate levels in the vmPFC using 3T 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and fear extinction (learning and recall) using 
      skin conductance responses during a 2-day experimental paradigm in OCD patients 
      (n = 17) and in healthy controls (HC; n = 13). Obsessive-compulsive patients 
      (n = 12) then received manualized CBT. Glutamate in the vmPFC was negatively 
      associated with fear extinction recall and positively associated with CBT outcome 
      (with higher glutamate levels predicting a better outcome) in OCD patients. 
      Glutamate levels in the vmPFC in OCD patients were not significantly different from 
      those in HC, and were not associated with OCD severity. Our results suggest that 
      glutamate in the vmPFC is associated with fear extinction recall and CBT outcome in 
      adult OCD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A 2010 meta-analysis of internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) RCTs argued 
      'computer therapy for the anxiety and depressive disorders was effective, acceptable 
      and practical health care' without data on effectiveness or practicality in routine 
      practice. METHODS: Databases, reviews and meta-analyses were searched for randomised 
      controlled trials of cCBT or iCBT versus a control group (care as usual, waitlist, 
      information control, psychological placebo, pill placebo, etc.) in people who met 
      diagnostic criteria for major depression, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or 
      generalised anxiety disorder. Number randomised, superiority of treatment versus 
      control (Hedges'g) on primary outcome measure, length of follow-up, follow up 
      outcome, patient adherence and satisfaction/harm were extracted; risk of bias was 
      assessed. A search for studies on effectiveness of iCBT in clinical practice was 
      conducted. RESULTS: 64 trials were identified. The mean effect size (efficacy) was 
      g = 0.80 (NNT 2.34), and benefit was evident across all four disorders. Improvement 
      was maintained at follow-with good acceptability. Research probity was good, and 
      bias risk low. In addition, nine studies comparing iCBT with traditional 
      face-to-face CBT and three comparing iCBT with bibliotherapy were identified. All 
      three modes of treatment delivery appeared equally beneficial. The results of 
      effectiveness studies were congruent with the results of the efficacy trials. 
      LIMITATIONS: Studies variably measured changes in quality of life and disability, 
      and the lack of comparisons with medications weakens the field. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      conclusions drawn in the original meta-analysis are now supported: iCBT for the 
      anxiety and depressive disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care.

TI  - Orexin in the anxiety spectrum: association of a HCRTR1 polymorphism with panic 
      disorder/agoraphobia, CBT treatment response and fear-related intermediate 
      phenotypes.
PG  - 75
LID - 10.1038/s41398-019-0415-8 [doi]
LID - 75
AB  - Preclinical studies point to a pivotal role of the orexin 1 (OX(1)) receptor in 
      arousal and fear learning and therefore suggest the HCRTR1 gene as a prime candidate 
      in panic disorder (PD) with/without agoraphobia (AG), PD/AG treatment response, and 
      PD/AG-related intermediate phenotypes. Here, a multilevel approach was applied to 
      test the non-synonymous HCRTR1 C/T Ile408Val gene variant (rs2271933) for 
      association with PD/AG in two independent case-control samples (total n = 613 cases, 
      1839 healthy subjects), as an outcome predictor of a six-weeks exposure-based 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in PD/AG patients (n = 189), as well as with 
      respect to agoraphobic cognitions (ACQ) (n = 483 patients, n = 2382 healthy 
      subjects), fMRI alerting network activation in healthy subjects (n = 94), and a 
      behavioral avoidance task in PD/AG pre- and post-CBT (n = 271). The HCRTR1 rs2271933 
      T allele was associated with PD/AG in both samples independently, and in their 
      meta-analysis (p = 4.2 × 10(-7)), particularly in the female subsample 
      (p = 9.8 × 10(-9)). T allele carriers displayed a significantly poorer CBT outcome 
      (e.g., Hamilton anxiety rating scale: p = 7.5 × 10(-4)). The T allele count was 
      linked to higher ACQ sores in PD/AG and healthy subjects, decreased inferior frontal 
      gyrus and increased locus coeruleus activation in the alerting network. Finally, the 
      T allele count was associated with increased pre-CBT exposure avoidance and 
      autonomic arousal as well as decreased post-CBT improvement. In sum, the present 
      results provide converging evidence for an involvement of HCRTR1 gene variation in 
      the etiology of PD/AG and PD/AG-related traits as well as treatment response to CBT, 
      supporting future therapeutic approaches targeting the orexin-related arousal 
      system.

AB  - We examined the feasibility and acceptability of using an immersive virtual reality 
      environment (VRE) alongside cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for young people with 
      autism experiencing specific phobia. Thirty-two participants were randomised to 
      treatment or control. Treatment involved one session introducing CBT techniques and 
      four VRE sessions, delivered by local clinical therapists. Change in target 
      behaviour was independently rated. Two weeks after treatment, four treatment 
      participants (25%) and no control participants were responders; at 6 months after 
      treatment, six (38%) treatment and no control participants were responders. At 
      6 months post-treatment, symptoms had worsened for one treatment and five control 
      (untreated) participants. Brief VRE exposure with CBT is feasible and acceptable to 
      deliver through child clinical services and is effective for some participants.

AB  - The gene coding for glycine receptor β subunits (GLRB) has been found to be related 
      to panic disorder and agoraphobia (PD/AG) and to be associated with altered insular 
      BOLD activation during fear conditioning, as an intermediate phenotype of defensive 
      system reactivity in healthy subjects. In a multicenter clinical trial on PD/AG 
      patients we investigated in three sub-samples whether GLRB allelic variation (A/G; 
      A-allele identified as «risk») in the single nucleotide polymorphism rs7688285 was 
      associated with autonomic (behavioral avoidance test BAT; n = 267 patients) and 
      neural (differential fear conditioning; n = 49 patients, n = 38 controls) measures, 
      and furthermore with responding towards exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT, n = 184 patients). An interaction of genotype with current PD/AG diagnosis 
      (PD/AG vs. controls; fMRI data only) and their modification after CBT was tested as 
      well. Exploratory fMRI results prior to CBT, revealed A-allele carriers irrespective 
      of diagnostic status to show overall higher BOLD activation in the hippocampus, 
      motor cortex (MC) and insula. Differential activation in the MC, anterior cingulate 
      cortex (ACC) and insula was found in the interaction genotype X diagnosis. 
      Differential activation in ACC and hippocampus was present in differential fear 
      learning. ACC activation was modified after treatment, while no overall rs7688285 
      dependent effect on clinical outcomes was found. On the behavioral level, A-allele 
      carriers showed pronounced fear reactivity prior to CBT which partially normalized 
      afterwards. In sum, rs7688285 variation interacts in a complex manner with PD/AG on 
      a functional systems level and might be involved in the development of PD/AG but not 
      in their treatment.

LID - 10.1111/acps.12169 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of three 
      empirically supported treatments for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy using a selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), or the combination of both (CBT+SSRI). METHOD: 
      Cost-effectiveness was examined based on the data from a multicenter randomized 
      controlled trial. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale was selected as a primary health 
      outcome measure. Data on costs from a societal perspective (i.e., direct medical, 
      direct non-medical, and indirect non-medical costs) were collected in the study 
      sample (N=150) throughout a 24-month period in which patients received active 
      treatment during the first twelve months and were seen twice for follow-up in the 
      next twelve months. RESULTS: Total costs were largely influenced by costs of the 
      interventions and productivity losses. The mean total societal costs were lower for 
      CBT as compared to SSRI and CBT+SSRI. Costs of medication use were substantial for 
      both SSRI and CBT+SSRI. When examining the balance between costs and health 
      outcomes, both CBT and CBT+SSRI led to more positive outcomes than SSRI. CONCLUSION: 
      Cognitive behavioral therapy is associated with the lowest societal costs. Cognitive 
      behavioral therapy and CBT+SSRI are more cost-effective treatments for panic 
      disorder with or without agoraphobia as compared to SSRI only.

AB  - Objective: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective intervention for 
      patients with panic disorder (PD). From a theoretical perspective, Eye Movement 
      Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy could also be useful in the 
      treatment of PD because: (1) panic attacks can be experienced as life threatening; 
      (2) panic memories specific to PD resemble traumatic memories as seen in 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and (3) PD often develops following a 
      distressing life event. The primary objective of this Randomized Controlled Trial 
      (RCT), was to compare EMDR therapy with CBT for PD and determine whether EMDR is not 
      worse than CBT in reducing panic symptoms and improving Quality Of Life (QOL). 
      Methods: Two-arm (CBT and EMDR) parallel RCT in patients with PD (N = 84). Patients 
      were measured at baseline (T1), directly after the last therapy session (T2), and 3 
      months after ending therapy (T3). Non-inferiority testing (linear mixed model with 
      intention-to-treat analysis) was applied. Patients were randomly assigned to 13 
      weekly 60-min sessions of CBT (N = 42) or EMDR therapy (N = 42). Standard protocols 
      were used. The primary outcome measure was severity of PD at T3, as measured with 
      the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ), the Body Sensations Questionnaire 
      (BSQ), and the Mobility Inventory (MI). The secondary outcome measure was QOL, as 
      measured with the World Health Organization Quality of Life short version 
      (WHOQOL-Bref), at T3. Results: The severity of PD variables ACQ and BSQ showed 
      non-inferiority of EMDR to CBT, while MI was inconclusive (adjusted analyses). 
      Overall QOL and general health, Psychological health, Social relationships, and 
      Environment showed non-inferiority of EMDR to CBT, while Physical health was 
      inconclusive. Conclusion: EMDR therapy proved to be as effective as CBT for treating 
      PD patients. Trial Registration: Dutch Trial Register, Nr. 3134

TI  - Comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Systemic Therapy for Social Anxiety 
      Disorder: Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial (SOPHO-CBT/ST).
LID - 10.1111/famp.12492 [doi]
AB  - This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to pilot the newly developed manualized 
      and monitored systemic therapy (ST) for social anxiety disorder (SAD), as compared 
      to manualized and monitored cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We conducted a 
      prospective multicenter, assessor-blind pilot RCT on 38 outpatients (ICD F40.1; 
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID); Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, 
      LSAS-SR >30). The primary outcome was level of social anxiety (LSAS-SR) at the end 
      of treatment. A total of 252 persons were screened, and 38 patients were randomized 
      and started therapy (CBT: 20 patients; ST: 18 patients; age: M = 36 years, SD = 14). 
      Within-group, simple-effect intent-to-treat analyses (ITT) showed significant 
      reduction in LSAS-SR (CBT: d = 1.04; ST: d = 1.67), while ITT mixed-design ANOVA 
      demonstrated the advantage of ST (d = 0.81). Per-protocol analyses supported these 
      results. Remission based on reliable change indices also demonstrated significant 
      difference (LSAS-SR: 15% in CBT; 39% in ST; h: 0.550), supported by blind 
      diagnosticians' ratings of those who completed therapy (SCID; 45% in CBT, 78% in ST, 
      p = .083). No adverse events were reported. CBT and ST both reduced social anxiety, 
      supporting patient improvement with the newly developed ST for SAD; this has yet to 
      be verified in a subsequent confirmatory RCT.

TI  - Exposure and CBT for chronic back pain: An RCT on differential efficacy and optimal 
      length of treatment.
PG  - 533-545
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000298 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to establish whether Exposure, a specialized tailored 
      treatment for chronic low back pain, has any advantages over cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) among individuals with high fear-avoidance levels. Second, we planned 
      to compare short and long versions of Exposure. Third, we aimed to investigate 
      whether Exposure can be delivered in an outpatient psychological setting. METHOD: A 
      total of 88 Caucasian participants (55% women) were randomized to three different 
      psychological treatment conditions, Exposure-long, Exposure-short, and CBT. All 
      participants were suffering from chronic pain and elevated levels of pain-related 
      anxiety and disability. The primary outcomes were disability (assessed using two 
      different questionnaires, QBPDS and PDI) and average pain intensity; secondary 
      outcomes included pain-related anxiety, psychological flexibility, coping 
      strategies, and depression. Assessments took place at pretreatment, midtreatment, 
      posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Exposure was more effective than CBT 
      at reducing movement-related disability assessed with the QBPDS. Exposure and CBT 
      did not differ in reduction of pain intensity or disability assessed using the PDI. 
      Exposure-short outperformed Exposure-long after 10 sessions, meaning that 
      individuals improved faster when they were offered fewer sessions. Exposure could be 
      safely delivered in the psychological setting. Concerning secondary outcomes, 
      Exposure led to greater improvements in psychological flexibility relative to CBT. 
      CBT was more effective than Exposure at enhancing coping strategies. In Exposure, 
      significantly more participants dropped out. CONCLUSIONS: Although being more 
      challenging to patients, Exposure is an effective treatment, which can be delivered 
      in a psychological treatment setting and should be offered as a short-term 
      treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record

      clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
PG  - 745-64
LID - 10.1586/erp.12.67 [doi]
AB  - Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) is a promising treatment that may 
      increase availability of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for psychiatric disorders 
      and other clinical problems. The main objective of this study was to determine the 
      applications, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ICBT. The authors 
      conducted a systematic review to identify randomized controlled trials investigating 
      CBT delivered via the internet for adult patient populations. Searches to identify 
      studies investigating cost-effectiveness of ICBT were also conducted. Evidence 
      status for each clinical application was determined using the American Psychologist 
      Association criteria for empirically supported treatments. Of 1104 studies reviewed, 
      108 met criteria for inclusion, of which 103 reported on clinical efficacy and eight 
      on cost-effectiveness. Results showed that ICBT has been tested for 25 different 
      clinical disorders, whereas most randomized controlled trials have been aimed at 
      depression, anxiety disorders and chronic pain. Internet-based treatments for 
      depression, social phobia and panic disorder were classified as well-established, 
      that is, meeting the highest level of criteria for evidence. Effect sizes were large 
      in the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, severe health anxiety, irritable 
      bowel syndrome, female sexual dysfunction, eating disorders, cannabis use and 
      pathological gambling. For other clinical problems, effect sizes were small to 
      moderate. Comparison to conventional CBT showed that ICBT produces equivalent 
      effects. Cost-effectiveness data were relatively scarce but suggested that ICBT has 
      more than 50% probability of being cost effective compared with no treatment or to 
      conventional CBT when willingness to pay for an additional improvement is zero. 
      Although ICBT is a promising treatment option for several disorders, it can only be 
      regarded as a well-established treatment for depression, panic disorder and social 
      phobia. It seems that ICBT is as effective as conventional CBT for respective 
      clinical disorder, that is, if conventional CBT works then ICBT works. The large 
      effects and the limited therapist time required suggest that the treatment is highly 
      cost effective for well-established indications.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Purpose of Review Management of treatment-resistant (TR) panic 
      disorder (PD) is an unresolved issue. In this paper, we provide a brief summary of 
      previous findings, an updated (2015-2017) systematic review of 
      pharmacological/non-pharmacological studies, and our personal perspective on this 
      topic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent Findings We found a very limited number of recent 
      findings. Quetiapine extended-release augmentation has not been found to be 
      beneficial, in comparison to placebo, in non-responders to previously recommended 
      pharmacotherapy. In non-responders to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), switching 
      to paroxetine/citalopram has been found to be more effective than continuing CBT. 
      Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has shown some improvement in patients' 
      resistance to previous psychological/pharmacological interventions compared with a 
      waiting-list condition. SUMMARY: Summary Previous and recent findings regarding the 
      treatment of TR PD suffer from several methodological limitations. Available studies 
      provide insufficient evidence to support the use of medications alternative to the 
      recommended medications; the efficacy of ACT needs confirmation with more rigorous 
      methodology. Prolonged pharmacotherapy may produce significant improvement in 
      patients with unsatisfactory response to short-term pharmacotherapy, while switching 
      to pharmacotherapy may help non-responders to CBT. We discuss our personal 
      perspective on the definition of "treatment resistance" as it relates to PD and 
      provide personalized intervention strategies to increase favorable clinical outcomes 
      based on our clinical expertise and review of experimental studies on the 
      pathophysiology of PD.

AB  - In panic disorder (PD), epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation of candidate 
      genes have been suggested to play a key role at the intersection of genetic and 
      environmental factors. On an epigenome-wide level, however, only two studies in PD 
      patients have been published so far, while to date no study has intra-individually 
      analyzed dynamic epigenetic correlates of treatment-response in PD on a DNA 
      methylome level. Here, an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed in a 
      sample of 57 PD patients and matched healthy controls using the Illumina 
      MethylationEPIC BeadChip, along with a longitudinal approach assessing changes on 
      the DNA methylome level corresponding to clinical effects of a manualized six-week 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in PD. While no epigenome-wide significant hits 
      could be discerned, top suggestive evidence was observed for decreased methylation 
      in PD at cg19917903 in the Cilia and Flagella Associated Protein 46 (CFAP46) gene, 
      and for an increase in methylation after CBT at cg06943668 in the Interleukin 1 
      Receptor Type 1 (IL1R1) gene in treatment responders to CBT. Additional exploratory 
      analyses based on biological validity and a combined statistical/biological ranking 
      point to further new potential PD risk genes such as the CCL4L1 or GMNN genes, and 
      suggest dynamic methylation of, e.g., the ZFP622 and the SLC43A2 genes along with 
      response to CBT. These EWAS and first longitudinal epigenome-wide pilot data in PD 
      add to the emerging candidate gene-based body of evidence for epigenetic mechanisms 
      to be involved in PD pathogenesis and to possibly constitute dynamic biological 
      correlates of therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Cognitive-Behavioral and Psychodynamic Therapy in Adolescents with Social Anxiety 
      Disorder: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 223-233
LID - 10.1159/000488990 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although social anxiety disorder (SAD) has an early onset and is 
      frequently found in adolescence, evidence for psychotherapeutic treatments of SAD in 
      adolescents is rather scarce. Within the Social Phobia Psychotherapy Research 
      Network (SOPHO-NET), we examined the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral (CBT) and 
      psychodynamic therapy (PDT) compared to a waiting list (WL) in these patients. 
      METHODS: In a multicenter randomized controlled superiority trial, 107 patients, 
      aged 14-20 years, were randomized to CBT (n = 34), PDT (n = 34), or WL (n = 39). 
      Assessments were made at baseline, at the end of treatment, and 6 and 12 months 
      after termination. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents 
      (LSAS-CA) applied by raters masked to the treatment condition was used as the 
      primary outcome. As secondary outcomes, rates of response and remission and the 
      Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) were used. RESULTS: Both treatments were 
      superior to WL in the LSAS-CA (CBT: p = 0.0112, d = 0.61, 95% CI 0.14-1.08; PDT: p = 
      0.0261, d = 0.53, 95% CI 0.06-1.00). At the end of treatment, response rates were 
      66, 54, and 20% for CBT, PDT, and WL. The corresponding remission rates were 47, 34, 
      and 6%, respectively. CBT and PDT were significantly superior to WL regarding 
      remission (CBT: p = 0.0009, h = 1.0; PDT: p = 0.0135, h = 0.74), response (CBT: p = 
      0.0004, h = 0.97; PDT: p = 0.0056, h = 0.72), and the SPAI (CBT: p = 0.0021, d = 
      0.75, 95% CI 0.27-1.22; PDT: p = 0.0060, d = 0.66, 95% CI 0.19-1.13). Treatment 
      effects were stable at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: These results are 
      comparable to the large SOPHO-NET trial in adults (n = 495). Early treatments for 
      social anxiety are needed in order to prevent chronic manifestation of SAD.

LID - 37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adolescents may be associated with the 
      use of maladaptive emotion regulation (ER) strategies. The present study examined 
      the use of maladaptive and adaptive ER strategies in adolescents with SAD. METHODS: 
      30 adolescents with SAD (CLIN) and 36 healthy adolescents for the control group 
      (CON) aged between 11 and 16 years were assessed with the standardized 
      questionnaires PHOKI (Phobiefragebogen für Kinder und Jugendliche) for self-reported 
      fears as well as FEEL-KJ (Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern 
      und Jugendlichen) for different emotion regulation strategies. RESULTS: Compared to 
      controls, adolescents with SAD used adaptive ER strategies significantly less often, 
      but made use of maladaptive ER strategies significantly more often. There was a 
      significant positive correlation between maladaptive ER and social anxiety in 
      adolescents. Examining group differences of single ER strategy use, the CLIN and CON 
      differed significantly in the use of the adaptive ER strategy reappraisal with CLIN 
      reporting less use of reappraisal than CON. Group differences regarding the 
      maladaptive ER strategies withdrawal and rumination, as well as the adaptive ER 
      strategy problem-solving were found present, with CLIN reporting more use of 
      withdrawal and rumination and less use of problem-solving than CON. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Promoting adaptive emotion regulation should be a central component of psychotherapy 
      (cognitive behavioral therapy-CBT) for social anxiety in adolescents from the 
      beginning of the therapy process. These findings provide rationale for special 
      therapy programs concentrating on the establishment of different adaptive ER 
      strategies (including reappraisal). As an increased use of maladaptive ER may be 
      associated with SAD in adolescents, it may be paramount to focus on reduction of 
      maladaptive ER (for example withdrawal and rumination) from the beginning of the 
      psychotherapy process. Incorporating more ER components into psychotherapy (CBT) 
      could increase the treatment efficacy. Further investigations of the patterns of 
      emotion regulation in specific anxiety groups like SAD in adolescents is needed to 
      continue to optimize the psychotherapy (CBT) concept.

TI  - Brief intervention, physical exercise and cognitive behavioural group therapy for 
      patients with chronic low back pain (The CINS trial).

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cognitive-behavioural treatments (CBT) and physical group 
      exercise (PE) have both shown promising effects in reducing disability and 
      increasing work participation among chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. A brief 
      cognitive intervention (BI) has previously been demonstrated to reduce work 
      disability in CLBP. The aim of this study was to test if the effect of BI could be 
      further increased by adding either group CBT or group PE. METHODS: A total of 214 
      patients, all sick listed 2-10 months due to CLBP, were randomized to BI (n = 99), 
      BI + group CBT (n = 55) or BI + group PE (n = 60). Primary outcome was increased 
      work participation at 12 months, whereas secondary outcomes included pain-related 
      disability, subjective health complaints, anxiety, depression, coping and fear 
      avoidance. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in work 
      participation at 12 months follow-up (χ(2)  = 1.15, p = 0.56). No significant 
      differences were found on the secondary outcomes either, except for a statistically 
      significant reduction (time by group) in pseudoneurology one domain of subjective 
      health complaints (sleep problems, tiredness, dizziness, anxiety, depression, 
      palpitation, heat flushes) (F(2,136)  = 3.109, p = 0.048) and anxiety (F(2,143) 
       = 4.899, p = 0.009) for the groups BI + group CBT and BI + group PE, compared to BI 
      alone. However, these differences were not significant in post hoc analyses (Scheffé 
      adjusted). CONCLUSION: There was no support for an effect of the added group CBT or 
      group PE treatments to a brief cognitive intervention in this study of patients on 
      sick leave due to low back pain. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates that 
      treatments that previously were found to be effective and are included in most 
      treatment guidelines, such as group cognitive-behavior therapy and exercise, were 
      not effective in this given context compared to a brief, cognitive intervention. 
      This implies that an optimized brief intervention is difficult to outperform in 
      patients on sick leave due to low back pain.

TI  - HPA AXIS RELATED GENES AND RESPONSE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES: GENETICS AND 
      EPIGENETICS.
PG  - 861-70
LID - 10.1002/da.22430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning has been 
      implicated in the development of stress-related psychiatric diagnoses and response 
      to adverse life experiences. This study aimed to investigate the association between 
      genetic and epigenetics in HPA axis and response to cognitive behavior therapy 
      (CBT). METHODS: Children with anxiety disorders were recruited into the Genes for 
      Treatment project (GxT, N = 1,152). Polymorphisms of FKBP5 and GR were analyzed for 
      association with response to CBT. Percentage DNA methylation at the FKBP5 and GR 
      promoter regions was measured before and after CBT in a subset (n = 98). Linear 
      mixed effect models were used to investigate the relationship between genotype, DNA 
      methylation, and change in primary anxiety disorder severity (treatment response). 
      RESULTS: Treatment response was not associated with FKBP5 and GR polymorphisms, or 
      pretreatment percentage DNA methylation. However, change in FKBP5 DNA methylation 
      was nominally significantly associated with treatment response. Participants who 
      demonstrated the greatest reduction in severity decreased in percentage DNA 
      methylation during treatment, whereas those with little/no reduction in severity 
      increased in percentage DNA methylation. This effect was driven by those with one or 
      more FKBP5 risk alleles, with no association seen in those with no FKBP5 risk 
      alleles. No significant association was found between GR methylation and response. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Allele-specific change in FKBP5 methylation was associated with 
      treatment response. This is the largest study to date investigating the role of HPA 
      axis related genes in response to a psychological therapy. Furthermore, this is the 
      first study to demonstrate that DNA methylation changes may be associated with 
      response to psychological therapies in a genotype-dependent manner.

AB  - Traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders has been 
      designed to target reductions in negative affect (NA) associated with 
      defense-related processes. However, a subset of anxiety disorders, including social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD), are also characterized by low positive affect (PA) resulting 
      from separate deficits in appetitive-related processes. In contrast to CBT, 
      "third-wave" approaches, such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), align more 
      consistently with motivational processes and, as a result, PA. However, the 
      differential effect of CBT and ACT on PA and NA has yet to be investigated. Using 
      secondary data from a randomized controlled trial, the present study sought to 
      compare CBT's (n = 45) and ACT's (n = 35) effect on PA and NA in SAD. Findings were 
      compared to a wait-list (WL) control condition (n = 31), as well as normative data 
      from a general adult sample. Baseline PA and NA were also examined as moderators and 
      predictors of theory-relevant treatment outcomes. NA decreased significantly in both 
      CBT and ACT from pre to posttreatment. Although ACT outperformed WL in reducing NA, 
      this effect was not observed for CBT. PA increased significantly in both CBT and ACT 
      from pre to posttreatment, with neither ACT nor CBT outperforming WL in increasing 
      PA. Neither PA nor NA were found to moderate theoretically relevant treatment 
      outcomes. Findings suggest that ACT and CBT share common treatment mechanisms, 
      making them more similar than distinct. Further efforts should be focused on 
      optimizing CBT's and ACT's influence on threat and reward learning, and elucidating 
      common processes of change.

AB  - Our aim was to evaluate isolated elements of psychological pain treatments and 
      explore treatment effects on biological stress markers. We employed a single-case 
      experimental design with multiple baselines. Matching pairs of twelve participants 
      (chronic low back pain >6 months; elevated pain-related fear) were randomly assigned 
      to graded in vivo exposure (EXP) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a yoked 
      design. Primary assessments were taken during baseline (7-26 days), treatment (23-44 
      days) and at 6-months follow-up (11-30 days) including changes in pain symptoms, 
      disability, pain-related fear, acceptance, body confidence, self-efficacy, and 
      positive thoughts. Psycho-educational, behavioral, cognitive, and exposure 
      interventions were compared to baseline. EXP exhibited immediate middle-to-large 
      effects; CBT's small-to-middle effects were delayed. Within the EXP approach, change 
      mainly occurred during exposure but not during psycho-educational sessions. Overall 
      cortisol was lower in EXP than CBT at post-treatment. We recommend integrating 
      exposure elements in the management of CLBP to increase its efficacy. 
      Psycho-educational sessions might not be necessary or should be adapted, e.g. with 
      stronger focus on motivational aspects. Since CBT seemed to produce delayed effects,

TI  - Are there advances in pharmacotherapy for panic disorder? A systematic review of the 
      past five years.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several effective medications are available for treating panic 
      disorder (PD). However, outcomes are unsatisfactory in a number of patients, 
      suggesting the usefulness of expanding the array of antipanic drugs and improving 
      the quality of response to current recommended treatments. AREAS COVERED: The 
      authors have performed an updated systematic review of pharmacological studies 
      (phase III onwards) to examine whether advances have been made in the last five 
      years. Only four studies were included. D-cycloserine no longer seemed promising as 
      a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) enhancer. Some preliminary findings concerning 
      the optimization of recommended medications deserved consideration, including: the 
      possibility that SSRIs are more effective than CBT alone in treating panic attacks, 
      combined therapy is preferable when agoraphobia is present, and clonazepam is more 
      potent than paroxetine in decreasing panic relapse. EXPERT OPINION: Given the lack 
      of novel treatments, expanding a personalized approach to the existing medications 
      seems to be the most feasible strategy to improve pharmacotherapy outcomes regarding 
      PD. Recent technological progress, including wearable devices collecting real-time 
      data, 'big data' platforms, and application of machine learning techniques might 
      help make outcome prediction more reliable. Further research on previously promising 
      novel treatments is also recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last few decades, there has been a growing interest in anxiety 
      disorders (AnxD) in the perinatal period. Although AnxD are diagnosed in 4-39% of 
      pregnant women and in up to 16% of women after delivery, evidence on their clinical 
      management is limited. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on pharmacological 
      and non-pharmacological treatment of AnxD in the perinatal period. Relevant papers 
      published from January 1st 2015 were identified searching the electronic databases 
      MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: 18 articles met 
      inclusion criteria. Selected studies supported the use of cognitive-behavioural 
      therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD) and 
      specific phobia both in pregnancy and postpartum. Selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs) led to significant OCD and PD improvement both in pregnancy and 
      postpartum with no side effects for the babies. In the largest clinical sample to 
      date, 65% of postpartum patients who entered the open-label trial of fluvoxamine (up 
      to 300mg/day) experienced a 30% or greater decrease in the total score of the 
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). During pregnancy, SSRIs and 
      tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) led to remission of panic symptoms and healthy 
      outcomes for the babies. LIMITATIONS: Study design, mostly case reports, and 
      enrolment of subjects mainly from outpatient specialty units might have limited 
      community-wide generalisability. CONCLUSIONS: Keeping in mind the scantiness and 
      heterogeneity of the available literature, the best interpretation of the available 
      evidence appears to be that CBT should be the first treatment offered to pregnant 
      and breastfeeding women with AnxD. However SSRIs can represent a first line 
      treatment strategy, and not exclusively in cases where AnxD is refractory to CBT.

AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated favorable long-term outcomes in 
      youth with anxiety disorders in efficacy trials. However, long-term outcomes of CBT 
      delivered in a community setting are uncertain. This study examined the long-term 
      outcomes of individual (ICBT) and group CBT (GCBT) in youth with anxiety disorders 
      treated in community mental health clinics. A total of 139 youth (mean age at 
      assessment 15.5 years, range 11-21 years) with a principal diagnosis of separation 
      anxiety disorder (SAD), social anxiety disorder (SOP), and/or generalized anxiety 
      disorder (GAD) were evaluated, on average, 3.9 years post-treatment (range 2.2-5.9 
      years). Outcomes included loss of all inclusion anxiety diagnoses, loss of the 
      principal anxiety diagnosis and changes in youth- and parent-rated youth anxiety 
      symptoms. At long-term follow-up, there was loss of all inclusion anxiety diagnoses 
      in 53%, loss of the principal anxiety diagnosis in 63% of participants as well as 
      significant reductions in all anxiety symptom measures. No statistical significant 
      differences in outcome were obtained between ICBT and GCBT. Participants with a 
      principal diagnosis of SOP had lower odds for recovery, compared to those with a 
      principal diagnosis of SAD or GAD. In conclusion, outcomes of CBT for youth anxiety 
      disorders delivered in community mental health clinics were improved at nearly 4 
      years post-treatment, and recovery rates at long-term follow-up were similar to 
      efficacy trials.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The fear of falling has a high prevalence in the community, and 
      intervention programs for this condition are scarce, making it is necessary to 
      strengthen this type of therapy in order to prevent adverse consequences in the 
      elderly population. OBJECTIVE: To establish the effectiveness of three intervention 
      programs in reducing the fear of falling and increasing functionality in elderly 
      people in the city of Manizales. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A randomised trial was 
      conducted on ambulatory elderly patients with fear of falling and functional 
      limitation of the city of Manizales. A total of 125 individuals were randomised to 
      one of three interventions: Tai Chi (TCh), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and 
      postural control (CP) exercises. The primary outcomes were: fear of falling 
      (evaluated by the Falls Efficacy Scale [FES-I]), and functionality using the Short 
      Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The data was collected before initiating the 
      interventions and after the 8 weeks intervention. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat 
      analysis was conducted on 119 elderly patients. The three interventions reduced the 
      fear of falling and increased physical performance, with no significant differences 
      observed between them (P=.13). As regards gait speed, differences were only found 
      between the pre- and post-intervention with CP (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      suggest that the TCh, CBT and CP interventions helped the elderly to reduce their 
      fear of falling. Only CP demonstrated an improvement in the speed of walking at the

TI  - Cognitive-behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older 
      people: therapy development and randomised controlled trial - the Strategies for 
      Increasing Independence, Confidence and Energy (STRIDE) study.
PG  - 1-206
LID - 10.3310/hta20560 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity 
      avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these 
      problems is 'fear of falling', seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence 
      of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no 
      previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. OBJECTIVES: Primary objective To 
      develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) 
      delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care 
      alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectives To measure the impact of the 
      intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality 
      of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the 
      intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote 
      or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the 
      intervention. DESIGN: Phase I CBTi development. Phase II Parallel-group patient 
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with 
      usual care alone. SETTING: Multidisciplinary falls services. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with 
      excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) 
      score of > 23. INTERVENTIONS: Phase I Development of the CBTi. The CBTi was 
      developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential 
      for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase II RCT. The CBTi was 
      delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual 
      care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 
      12 months. Primary outcome measure Fear of falling measured by change in FES-I 
      scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, 
      anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, 
      social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were 
      process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial. RESULTS: Four hundred 
      and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 
      205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [-4.02; 
      95% confidence interval (CI) -5.95 to -2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling 
      scale (-1.42; 95% CI -1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (-1; 95% CI -1.6 to -0.3) scores at 12 
      months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no 
      differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi 
      acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice 
      were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling 
      and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was 
      no impact on other measures. FURTHER WORK: Further work should focus on a joint CBTi 
      and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, 
      the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of 
      provision of CBTi by non-specialists. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials

TI  - Combining physical therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to improve 
      balance confidence and community participation in people with unilateral transtibial 
      amputation who use lower limb prostheses: a study protocol for a randomized 
      sham-control clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low balance confidence is a prevalent yet overlooked issue among people 
      who use lower limb prostheses (LLP) that can diminish community integration and 
      quality of life. There is a critical need to develop rehabilitation programs that 
      specifically target balance confidence in people who use LLP. Previous research has 
      shown that multicomponent interventions including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      techniques and exercise are feasible and effective for improving balance confidence 
      in older adults. Therefore, a cognitive behavioral-physical therapy (CBPT) 
      intervention was developed to target balance confidence and increase community 
      integration in people who use LLP. METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized control trial 
      will recruit 60 people who use LLP with low balance confidence. Participants will be 
      randomized to the CBPT intervention condition or control condition. DISCUSSION: The 
      trial is designed to test the effects of the CBPT intervention on balance confidence 
      and functional mobility in lower limb prosthesis users by examining self-reported 
      and objective measures of community integration and quality of life. The trial will 
      also examine the relationship between changes in balance confidence and changes in 
      community integration following participation in CBPT intervention. Additionally, 
      through participant feedback, researchers will identify opportunities to improve 
      intervention efficacy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03411148.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy, sertraline, or a combination in childhood anxiety.
PG  - 2753-66
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa0804633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are common psychiatric conditions affecting children 
      and adolescents. Although cognitive behavioral therapy and selective 
      serotonin-reuptake inhibitors have shown efficacy in treating these disorders, 
      little is known about their relative or combined efficacy. METHODS: In this 
      randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 488 children between the ages of 7 and 17 
      years who had a primary diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, generalized 
      anxiety disorder, or social phobia to receive 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral 
      therapy, sertraline (at a dose of up to 200 mg per day), a combination of sertraline 
      and cognitive behavioral therapy, or a placebo drug for 12 weeks in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. 
      We administered categorical and dimensional ratings of anxiety severity and 
      impairment at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: The percentages of 
      children who were rated as very much or much improved on the Clinician Global 
      Impression-Improvement scale were 80.7% for combination therapy (P<0.001), 59.7% for 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (P<0.001), and 54.9% for sertraline (P<0.001); all 
      therapies were superior to placebo (23.7%). Combination therapy was superior to both 
      monotherapies (P<0.001). Results on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale documented a 
      similar magnitude and pattern of response; combination therapy had a greater 
      response than cognitive behavioral therapy, which was equivalent to sertraline, and 
      all therapies were superior to placebo. Adverse events, including suicidal and 
      homicidal ideation, were no more frequent in the sertraline group than in the 
      placebo group. No child attempted suicide. There was less insomnia, fatigue, 
      sedation, and restlessness associated with cognitive behavioral therapy than with 
      sertraline. CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive behavioral therapy and sertraline reduced 
      the severity of anxiety in children with anxiety disorders; a combination of the two 
      therapies had a superior response rate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00052078.)

TI  - Virtual reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy for patients with generalized 
      social anxiety disorder: a pilot study.
PG  - 745-750
LID - 10.1017/S1352465819000225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD) avoid various 
      social situations and can be reluctant to engage in in vivo exposure therapy. Highly 
      personalized practising can be required before patients are ready to perform in vivo 
      exposure. Virtual reality-based therapy could be beneficial for this group. AIMS: To 
      assess the feasibility and potential effect of virtual reality-based cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (VR-CBT) for patients with severe generalized SAD. METHODS: 
      Fifteen patients with generalized SAD attended up to 16 VR-CBT sessions. 
      Questionnaires on clinical and functional outcomes, and diary assessments on social 
      activity, social anxiety and paranoia were completed at baseline, post-treatment and 
      at 6-months follow-up. RESULTS: Two patients dropped out of treatment. Improvements 
      in social anxiety and quality of life were found at post-treatment. At follow-up, 
      depressive symptoms had decreased, and the effect on social anxiety was maintained. 
      With respect to diary assessments, social anxiety in company and paranoia were 
      significantly reduced by post-treatment. These improvements were maintained at 
      follow-up. No increase was observed in social activity. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      uncontrolled pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and treatment potential of 
      VR-CBT in a difficult-to-treat group of patients with generalized SAD. Results 
      suggest that VR-CBT may be effective in reducing anxiety as well as depression, and 
      can increase quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This two-year follow-up study evaluated the long-term 
      outcomes of two early interventions that aimed at reducing social and test anxiety 
      in young adolescents at risk for developing social anxiety disorder. METHODS: In 
      this RCT, moderately socially anxious adolescents (N=240, mean age 13.6 years) were 
      randomly assigned to a 10-week internet-based multifaceted cognitive bias 
      modification training (CBM), a 10-week school-based cognitive behavioral group 
      training (CBT), or a no-intervention control condition. Using multiple imputation, 
      this study examined the changes in primary and secondary outcome measures from 
      pretest to follow-up in a repeated measures design. RESULTS: Primary outcome: 
      Self-reported social and test anxiety generally decreased from pre-test to two-year 
      follow-up, regardless of treatment condition. The percentage of adolescents who 
      developed a social anxiety disorder was very low (6%) and similar across conditions. 
      Secondary outcome: There were beneficial changes in self-esteem, self-reported 
      prosocial behaviors, and fear of negative evaluation, but none of these were related 
      to treatment condition. Automatic social-threat associations did not significantly 
      change. The CBM intervention was effective in changing interpretative bias as 
      indexed by the Recognition Task but this long-term effect did not transfer to the 
      Adolescent Interpretation and Belief Questionnaire. LIMITATIONS: There was a 
      substantial (50%) though seemingly non-selective attrition at follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This RCT does not support the longer-term efficacy of school-based CBT 
      or CBM as an early intervention for social and test anxiety. Rather, it emphasizes 
      the positive 'natural' course of highly socially anxious adolescents over two years.

AB  - Numerous studies have provided evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) on panic disorders (PDs). There has also been growing 
      attention on brief CBT with regard to delivering intensive treatment efficiently. 
      This study investigated the essential parts of mindfulness-based brief CBT to 
      optimize treatment benefits.A total of 37 patients were retrospectively enrolled in 
      this study. They were recruited from the anxiety/panic/fear clinic of Seoul National 
      University Hospital. The patients participated in group CBT once a week for a total 
      of 4 sessions over a 4-week period, when they were assessed using the Panic Disorder 
      Severity Scale (PDSS), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised (ASI-R), Albany Panic and 
      Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Anxiety 
      Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Yale-Brown Obsessive 
      Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) before and after brief CBT. Twenty-nine patients completed 
      the 1-month follow-up.There were significant reductions in PDSS (P < .001), 
      ASI-R-fear of respiratory symptoms (P = .006), ASI-R-fear of publicly observable 
      anxiety reaction (P = .002), ASI-R-fear of cardiovascular symptoms (P < .001), 
      ASI-R-fear of cognitive dyscontrol (P = .001), ASI-R-Total (P < .001), 
      APPQ-Agoraphobia (P = .003), APPQ-Total (P = .028), STAI-State anxiety (P < .001), 
      STAI-Trait anxiety (P = .002), BAI (P = .003), and BDI (P < .001) scores. We also 
      found significant associations between ASI-R-fear of cardiovascular symptoms, 
      ASI-R-Total, and changes in PDSS scores. A stepwise multiple linear regression 
      analysis indicated that anxiety sensitivity for fear of cardiovascular symptoms 
      predicted an improvement in panic severity (β = 0.513, P = .004).Our findings 
      suggested that behavioral aspects, especially physiological symptom control, needed 
      to be considered in brief, intensive CBT for PD. The results also suggested that a 
      mindfulness-based brief CBT approach might be particularly helpful for patients with 
      PD who have severe cardiovascular symptoms.

TI  - How Therapeutic Tapping Can Alter Neural Correlates of Emotional Prosody Processing 
      in Anxiety.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci9080206 [doi]
LID - 206
AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common psychological disorders worldwide resulting in 
      a great demand of adequate and cost-effective treatment. New short-term 
      interventions can be used as an effective adjunct or alternative to pharmaco- and 
      psychotherapy. One of these approaches is therapeutic tapping. It combines somatic 
      stimulation of acupressure points with elements from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 
      (CBT). Tapping reduces anxiety symptoms after only one session. Anxiety is 
      associated with a deficient emotion regulation for threatening stimuli. These 
      deficits are compensated e.g., by CBT. Whether Tapping can also elicit similar 
      modulations and which dynamic neural correlates are affected was subject to this 
      study. Anxiety patients were assessed listening to pseudowords with a different 
      emotional prosody (happy, angry, fearful, and neutral) prior and after one Tapping 
      session. The emotion-related component Late Positive Potential (LPP) was 
      investigated via electroencephalography. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) served 
      as control intervention. Results showed LPP reductions for negative stimuli after 
      the interventions. Interestingly, PMR influenced fearful and Tapping altered angry 
      prosody. While PMR generally reduced arousal for fearful prosody, Tapping 
      specifically affected fear-eliciting, angry stimuli, and might thus be able to 
      reduce anxiety symptoms. Findings highlight the efficacy of Tapping and its impact 
      on neural correlates of emotion regulation.

TI  - Smartphone problem-solving and behavioural activation therapy to reduce fear of 
      recurrence among patients with breast cancer (SMartphone Intervention to LEssen fear 
      of cancer recurrence: SMILE project): protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e024794
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024794 [doi]
LID - e024794
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One of the most common distressing conditions experienced by breast 
      cancer survivors is fear of cancer recurrence (FCR). There is, however, no standard 
      intervention for ameliorating FCR. Our clinical experience and previous studies have 
      suggested the potential benefits of problem-solving therapy (PST) and behavioural 
      activation (BA). Given the huge number of cancer survivors and limited number of 
      therapists to competently conduct PST and BA, we have developed PST and BA 
      smartphone applications. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the 
      smartphone-based PST (Kaiketsu-App) and BA (Genki-App) apps in reducing FCR in 
      patients with breast cancer. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The SMartphone Intervention to 
      LEssen fear of cancer recurrence project is an open-label, individually randomised, 
      parallel-group trial. Allocation will be managed by a central server using a 
      computer-generated random allocation sequence provided by an independent data 
      centre. Participants will be randomised to smartphone-based intervention plus 
      treatment as usual (TAU) or waitlist control with TAU alone. The primary endpoint of 
      the study is the Japanese version of the Concerns About Recurrence Scale, which will 
      be administered as an electronic patient-reported outcome on the patients' 
      smartphone after 8 weeks. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The present study is subject to 
      the ethical guidelines for clinical studies published by Japan's Ministry of 
      Education, Science and Technology and Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and the 
      modified Act on the Protection of Personal Information as well as the ethical 
      principles established for research on humans stipulated in the Declaration of 
      Helsinki and further amendments thereto. The protocol was approved by the 
      Institutional Review Board of Nagoya City University on 15 January 2018 (ID: 
      60-00-1171). TRIAL STATUS: The randomised trial, which commenced on 2 April 2018, 
      currently enrols participants. The estimated end date for this study is in March 
      2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000031140; Pre-results.

AB  - One of the core features of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the persistent fear of 
      being evaluated. Fear of evaluation includes fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and 
      fear of positive evaluation (FPE). Few studies have examined the relationship 
      between self-reported FNE and FPE and neural responses to simulated negative and 
      positive social evaluation. In the current study, 56 participants, 35 with SAD and 
      21 healthy controls, completed questionnaires to assess dimensions of social anxiety 
      including FNE and FPE, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. Participants 
      also completed a social evaluation task, which involved viewing people delivering 
      criticism and praise, and a control task, which involved counting asterisks, during 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although whole-brain analyses did not reveal 
      significant associations between self-reported constructs and neural responses to 
      social evaluation, region of interest analyses for the sample as a whole revealed 
      that both FNE and social anxiety symptoms were associated with greater neural 
      responses to both criticism and praise in emotion-processing brain regions, 
      including the amygdala and anterior insula. There were no significant associations 
      between FPE or depressive symptoms and neural responses to criticism or praise for 
      the sample as a whole. Future research should examine the relationship between FNE, 
      FPE, and neural responses to self-referent social evaluation in an unselected sample 
      to assess a full range of fear of evaluation.

TI  - Efficacy of two brief cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation programs for chronic neck 
      pain: results of a randomized controlled pilot study.
PG  - 890-899
LID - 10.23736/S1973-9087.18.05206-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current models of pain behavior suggest that kinesiophobia prevents the 
      reacquisition of normal function, promotes the development of maladaptive coping 
      strategies, and contributes to the disability associated with chronic neck pain 
      (NP). AIM: Comparing two brief cognitive-behavioral programs aimed at managing 
      kinesiophobia to understand which one induces better short-term improvements in 
      disability, fear of movement, catastrophizing, adaptive coping strategies, quality 
      of life (QoL), and pain intensity of chronic NP. DESIGN: Pilot, randomized, 
      controlled trial, 3-months follow-up. SETTING: Outpatients. POPULATION: Subjects 
      with chronic NP. METHODS: The population was randomized into two groups: group A 
      (N.=15) underwent four sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) based on the 
      NeckPix© (1-week duration); group B (N.=15) received four sessions of CBT based on 
      the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) (1-week duration). Afterwards, both groups 
      attended 10 sessions of multimodal exercises (5-week duration). Primary measure: 
      Neck Disability Index (NDI). Secondary measures: NeckPix©, TSK, Pain Catastrophizing 
      Scale, Chronic Pain Coping Inventory, EuroQol-Five Dimensions, and pain intensity 
      Numerical Rating Scale. STATISTICS: Linear mixed model analyses for repeated 
      measures for each outcome measure to evaluate changes over time and between group. 
      RESULTS: A significant effect of time was found for all outcomes, while no outcomes 
      showed group and/or interaction effects. No changes were found in terms of NDI at 
      the end of CBT, while a significant improvement of about 13 points was found for 
      both groups at the end of the motor training (P=0.001). Similarly, in terms of 
      quality of life there was no change after the CBT program, and a significant change 
      at the end of the motor training, with a partial loss at follow-up. From CBT 
      sessions to follow-up both groups showed a progressive reduction in kinesiophobia, 
      with each group achieving a bigger change in the specific scale used for the CBT 
      program. CONCLUSIONS: Two brief cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation programs based 
      on different methodologies of managing fear-avoidance beliefs induced similar 
      short-term improvements in subjects with chronic NP. Clinically significant changes 
      in terms of disability were found in both groups only at the end of a 5-week motor 
      training, regardless of the cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation program previously 
      administrated. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Treatment of chronic NP requires 
      cognitive modifications closely linked to physical performances in order to achieve 
      mental adjustments and guarantee cognitive-behavioral as well as motor lasting 
      changes.

TI  - Severity of panic disorder, adverse events in childhood, dissociation, self-stigma 
      and comorbid personality disorders Part 2: Therapeutic effectiveness of a combined 
      cognitive behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy in treatment-resistant inpatients.
PG  - 271-283
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A combination of antidepressants with the cognitive-behavioural therapy 
      showed effectiveness in treatment-resistant patients with panic disorder. This 
      prospective study intended to establish how childhood adverse experiences, 
      self-stigma, dissociation, and severity of psychopathology influence the 
      effectiveness of combined cognitive-behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy in 
      patients with treatment-resistant panic disorder. METHODS: One hundred and ten 
      patients were included into the study and one hundred five subjects finished the 
      study. After admission, the subjects were assessed during the first two days of 
      hospitalization. Rating scales were administered before the beginning of the 
      cognitive behavioural therapy (measurement-1) and at the end of the treatment which 
      was after six weeks (measurement-2). Patients with panic disorder were treated using 
      a combination of group cognitive-behavioural therapy and antidepressants. The usual 
      antidepressant dosage range was used. Before admission to intensive cognitive 
      behavioural therapy program, the patients were unsuccessfully treated by 
      antidepressants for minimum 3 months, which defined them as pharmacoresistant. 
      RESULTS: Hospitalized pharmacoresistant patients with panic disorder improved 
      significantly throughout the 6-week intensive CBT program in all measurements that 
      assessed the overall severity of the disorder, the degree of general anxiety and 
      depression and the severity of specific symptoms of panic disorder and agoraphobia. 
      The rate of improvement was negatively related to sexual abuse in childhood, 
      presence of comorbid personality disorder, and positively with the severity of the 
      disorder at the beginning, and the level of self-stigma at the beginning of 
      treatment. Improvement in symptoms correlates significantly with decreasing of 
      dissociation during the treatment.severity of depressive symptoms. The earlier 
      development of the disorder is linked to higher score in childhood adverse events, 
      higher level of dissociation and pathological dissociation, and higher level of 
      self-stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study discovers importance of the role of 
      adverse childhood experiences, self-stigma, dissociation and comorbid personality 
      disorder in effectiveness of combined cognitive-behavioural therapy and 
      pharmacotherapy treatment in patients with treatment-resistant panic disorder.

TI  - Exercise in the treatment of clinical anxiety in general practice - a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 559

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are common, yet treatment options in general practice 
      are often limited to medication or CBT. There is a lack of evidence for the 
      effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of anxiety in patients who present to 
      general practice and also about the intensity of exercise required to lead to 
      improvement. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the use of exercise 
      versus waiting list control groups in the treatment of anxiety and also to assess 
      the benefit of high intensity exercise vs low intensity exercise. Long term follow 
      up scores were also analysed. We included patients who met diagnostic criteria for 
      anxiety disorders or had clinically raised anxiety levels on a validated rating 
      scale and performed a subgroup analysis of the outcomes between the two groups. The 
      intervention was any aerobic exercise programme carried out for at least two weeks, 
      or exercise carried out at high intensity for at least two weeks. The comparison 
      groups were either a waiting list control group or low intensity exercise. METHOD: 
      Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Three databases were searched; 
      CENTRAL, Medline and Embase. Outcome assessment was based on validated anxiety 
      rating scales. The quality of the studies was appraised according to the Cochrane 
      Risk of Bias tool. Effect sizes were calculated using the standardised mean 
      difference. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were identified with a total of 675 patients. 
      Nine trials had participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders and six trials had 
      participants with raised anxiety on a validated rating scale. Aerobic exercise was 
      effective in the treatment of raised anxiety compared to waiting list control groups 
      (effect size - 0.41, 95% CI = - 0.70 to - 0.12). High intensity exercise programmes 
      showed greater effects than low intensity programmes. There was no significant 
      difference in outcomes between groups of patients with diagnosed anxiety disorders 
      and patients who had raised anxiety on a rating scale. Conclusions were limited by 
      the small number of studies and wide variation in the delivery of exercise 
      interventions. CONCLUSION: Exercise programmes are a viable treatment option for the 
      treatment of anxiety. High intensity exercise regimens were found to be more 
      effective than low intensity regimens. The results have implications for the use of 
      exercise schemes in General Practice.

      REVIEW METHODS: We included randomized and non-randomized comparative studies that 
      compared psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination in children ages 3 to 18 
      years with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, generalized 
      anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety. Pairs of independent reviewers selected 
      studies using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: We included 
      206 studies. Compared with pill placebo, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors improved primary anxiety symptoms 
      (moderate to high strength of evidence [SOE]). Tricyclic antidepressants marginally 
      improved clinical response (low SOE). Benzodiazepines did not show significant 
      improvement in primary anxiety symptoms (low SOE). Data on head-to-head comparisons 
      across drugs were sparse (only 2 RCTs; low SOE). Compared with waitlisting or no 
      treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improved primary anxiety symptoms 
      (clinician, child, and parent report), function, remission, and clinical response 
      (low to moderate SOE). Compared with other therapies (attention control or treatment 
      as usual), CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms (child report; moderate SOE). 
      Compared with CBT alone, the combination of imipramine and CBT reduced primary 
      anxiety symptoms (child report) and function (moderate SOE). The combination of 
      sertraline and CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms (clinician report), improved 
      function, and increased clinical response compared with CBT alone or sertraline 
      alone (moderate SOE). CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms and improved function 
      more than fluoxetine, and was more likely to increase remission than sertraline. 
      Medications increased short-term adverse events that were mostly not serious (low or 
      moderate SOE). Studies were too small or too short to assess suicidality with SSRI 
      or SNRI. One trial showed a statistically nonsignificant increase in suicidal 
      ideation with venlafaxine (low SOE). CONCLUSIONS: CBT is effective in reducing 
      anxiety symptoms and improving function. Medications, primarily those targeting 
      serotonin, are also effective and were associated with various short-term adverse 
      events, which were mostly not serious, but studies were too small or too short to 
      assess suicidality with SSRI or SNRI. The combination of medications and CBT is 
      likely more effective than either treatment alone. Comparative effectiveness 
      evidence between various medications and comparing CBT versus medications, or the 
      combination, is limited and represents a need for research in this field. Future 
      research is needed to evaluate components of CBT, effect modifiers of treatment, and 
      long-term safety of drugs, and needs to be more inclusive of underserved populations 
      and minorities.

TI  - Stepped Care Versus Direct Face-to-Face Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Social 
      Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder: A Randomized Effectiveness Trial.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) stepped care model (psychoeducation, guided Internet treatment, and 
      face-to-face CBT) compared with direct face-to-face (FtF) CBT. Patients with panic 
      disorder or social anxiety disorder were randomized to either stepped care (n=85) or 
      direct FtF CBT (n=88). Recovery was defined as meeting two of the following three 
      criteria: loss of diagnosis, below cut-off for self-reported symptoms, and 
      functional improvement. No significant differences in intention-to-treat recovery 
      rates were identified between stepped care (40.0%) and direct FtF CBT (43.2%). The 
      majority of the patients who recovered in the stepped care did so at the less 
      therapist-demanding steps (26/34, 76.5%). Moderate to large within-groups effect 
      sizes were identified at posttreatment and 1-year follow-up. The attrition rates 
      were high: 41.2% in the stepped care condition and 27.3% in the direct FtF CBT 
      condition. These findings indicate that the outcome of a stepped care model for 
      anxiety disorders is comparable to that of direct FtF CBT. The rates of improvement 
      at the two less therapist-demanding steps indicate that stepped care models might be 
      useful for increasing patients' access to evidence-based psychological treatments 
      for anxiety disorders. However, attrition in the stepped care condition was high, 
      and research regarding the factors that can improve adherence should be prioritized.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy for irritable bowel syndrome: the effects on state and 
      trait anxiety and the autonomic nervous system during induced rectal distensions - 
      An uncontrolled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is a common multifactorial 
      gastrointestinal disorder linked to disturbances in the microbe gut-brain axis. 
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in face-to-face format has showed promising 
      results on IBS and its associated psychological symptoms. The present study explored 
      for the first time if CBT for IBS affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS) during 
      experimentally induced visceral pain and cognitive stress, respectively. The levels 
      of state and trait anxiety, current and perceived stress were also evaluated. 
      METHODS: In this uncontrolled trial, individual CBT was performed in face-to-face 
      format for 12 weeks in 18 subjects with IBS. Heart rate variability and skin 
      conductance were measured during experimentally induced visceral pain and during a 
      cognitive task (Stroop color-word test), before and after intervention. The levels 
      of state and trait anxiety as well as self-rated current and perceived stress were 
      also measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: CBT did not affect ANS 
      activity during experimentally induced visceral pain and cognitive stress. The 
      sympathetic activity was high, typical for IBS and triggered during both visceral 
      pain and cognitive stress. The levels of state and trait anxiety significantly 
      decreased after the intervention. No significant changes in self-rated current or 
      perceived stress were found. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that face-to-face CBT for 
      IBS improved anxiety- a key psychological mechanism for the IBS pathophysiology, 
      rather than the autonomic stress response to experimentally induced visceral pain 
      and cognitive stress, respectively. IMPLICATIONS: This study indicates that IBS 
      patients present high levels of stress and difficulties coping with anxiety and ANS 
      activity during visceral pain and a cognitive stress test, respectively. These 
      manifestations of IBS are however not targeted by CBT, and do not seem to be central 
      for the study participants IBS symptoms according to the current and our previous 
      study. Face-to-face CBT for IBS, it does not seem to affect modulation of ANS 
      activity in response to induced visceral pain or cognitive stress. Instead, 
      face-to-face CBT decreased levels of state and trait anxiety. Implications for 
      further studies include that anxiety seems to be important in the IBS 
      pathophysiology, and needs further scientific attention. This is in line with the 
      fear-avoidance model which suggests that anxious responses to pain and discomfort 
      drive hypervigilance to, and (behavioral) avoidance of, symptom provoking stimuli 
      and vice versa. Catastrophic cognitions, hypervigilance and avoidant behavioral 
      responses are proposed to produce vicious circles that withhold and exacerbate 
      pain-related symptoms and disability, and lead to lower quality of life. Larger 
      scale studies of potential autonomic changes are needed in order to elucidate which 
      mechanisms elicit its effects in face-to-face CBT for IBS, and provide new avenues 
      in understanding the pathophysiology of IBS.

TI  - Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With Real-Time Therapist Support via 
      Videoconference for Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, and 
      Social Anxiety Disorder: Pilot Single-Arm Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment for 
      adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), and social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD). Patients in rural areas can access CBT via the internet. The 
      effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been 
      consistently shown, but no clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of 
      ICBT with real-time therapist support via videoconference for OCD, PD, and SAD at 
      the same time. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of 
      videoconference-delivered CBT for patients with OCD, PD, or SAD. METHODS: A total of 
      30 Japanese participants (mean age 35.4 years, SD 9.2) with OCD, SAD, or PD received 
      16 sessions of individualized videoconference-delivered CBT with real-time support 
      of a therapist, using tablet personal computer (Apple iPad Mini 2). Treatment 
      involved individualized CBT formulations specific to the presenting diagnosis; all 
      sessions were provided by the same therapist. The primary outcomes were reduction in 
      symptomatology, using the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) for OCD, 
      Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) for PD, and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale 
      (LSAS) for SAD. The secondary outcomes included the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) for 
      Quality of Life, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, the 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire for anxiety, and Working Alliance 
      Inventory-Short Form (WAI-SF). All primary outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 
      weeks 1 (baseline), 8 (midintervention), and 16 (postintervention) face-to-face 
      during therapy. The occurrence of adverse events was observed after each session. 
      For the primary analysis comparing between pre- and posttreatments, the 
      participants' points and 95% CIs were estimated by the paired t tests with the 
      change between pre- and posttreatment. RESULTS: A significant reduction in symptom 
      of obsession-compulsion (Y-BOCS=-6.2; Cohen d=0.74; 95% CI -9.4 to -3.0, P=.002), 
      panic (PDSS=-5.6; Cohen d=0.89; 95% CI -9.83 to -1.37; P=.02), social anxiety 
      (LSAS=-33.6; Cohen d=1.10; 95% CI -59.62 to -7.49, P=.02) were observed. In 
      addition, depression (PHQ-9=-1.72; Cohen d=0.27; 95% CI -3.26 to -0.19; P=.03) and 
      general anxiety (GAD-7=-3.03; Cohen d=0.61; 95% CI -4.57 to -1.49, P<.001) were 
      significantly improved. Although there were no significant changes at 16 weeks from 
      baseline in EQ-5D (0.0336; Cohen d=-0.202; 95% CI -0.0198 to 0.00869; P=.21), there 
      were high therapeutic alliance (ie, WAI-SF) scores (from 68.0 to 73.7) throughout 
      treatment, which significantly increased (4.14; 95% CI 1.24 to 7.04; P=.007). Of the 
      participants, 86% (25/29) were satisfied with videoconference-delivered CBT, and 83% 
      (24/29) preferred videoconference-delivered CBT to face-to-face CBT. An adverse 
      event occurred to a patient with SAD; the incidence was 3% (1/30). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Videoconference-delivered CBT for patients with OCD, SAD, and SAD may be feasible 
      and acceptable.

LID - 18
AB  - Chronic pain can result from many pain syndromes including complex regional pain 
      syndrome (CRPS), phantom limb pain and chronic low back pain, among others. On a 
      molecular level, chronic pain syndromes arise from hypersensitization within the 
      dorsal horn of the spinal cord, a process known as central sensitization. Central 
      sensitization involves an upregulation of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate 
      receptors (mGluRs) similar to that of long-term potentiation (LTP). Regions of the 
      brain in which LTP occurs, such as the amygdala and hippocampus, are implicated in 
      fear- and memory-related brain circuity. Chronic pain dramatically influences 
      patient quality of life. Individuals with chronic pain may develop pain-related 
      anxiety and pain-related fear. The syndrome also alters functional connectivity in 
      the default-mode network (DMN) and salience network. On a cellular/molecular level, 
      central sensitization may be reversed through degradative glutamate receptor 
      pathways. This, however, rarely happens. Instead, cortical brain regions may serve 
      in a top-down regulatory capacity for the maintenance or alleviation of pain. 
      Specifically, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which plays a critical role in 
      fear-related brain circuits, the DMN, and salience network may be the driving forces 
      in this process. On a cellular level, the mPFC may form new neural circuits through 
      LTP that may cause extinction of pre-existing pain pathways found within 
      fear-related brain circuits, the DMN, and salience network. In order to promote new 
      LTP connections between the mPFC and other key brain structures, such as the 
      amygdala and insula, we propose a holistic rehabilitation program including 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and revolving around: (1) cognitive reappraisals; 
      (2) mindfulness meditation; and (3) functional rehabilitation. Unlike current 
      medical interventions focusing upon pain-relieving medications, we do not believe 
      that chronic pain treatment should focus on reversing the effects of central 
      sensitization. Instead, we propose here that it is critical to focus on non-invasive 
      efforts to promote new neural circuits originating from the mPFC.

TI  - Moderators of intensive CBT for adolescent panic disorder: the of fear and 
      avoidance.
PG  - 30-36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research supports the efficacy of intensive cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) for the treatment of adolescent panic disorder with or without agoraphobia 
      (PDA). However, little is known about the conditions under which intensive treatment 
      is most effective. The current investigation examined the moderating roles of 
      baseline fear and avoidance in the intensive treatment of adolescent PDA. METHODS: 
      Adolescents with PDA (ages 11-17; N = 54) were randomized to either an intensive CBT 
      treatment (n = 37) or a waitlist control condition (n = 17). PDA diagnosis, symptom 
      severity, and number of feared and avoided situations were assessed at baseline and 
      6-week post-treatment/post-waitlist. Hierarchical regression analyses examined the 
      relative contributions of treatment condition, number of baseline feared or avoided 
      situations, and their interactions in the prediction of post-treatment/waitlist PDA 
      symptoms. RESULTS: The main effect of intensive CBT on post-treatment PDA symptoms 
      was not uniform across participants, with larger treatment effects found among 
      participants with lower, relative to higher, baseline levels of fear and avoidance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings help clarify which adolescents suffering with PDA may benefit 
      most from an intensive treatment format.

AB  - Among children and adolescents, anxiety disorders are common psychiatric disorders 
      that confer risk of comorbid psychiatric disorders and social and academic 
      impairment. This review focuses on the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders 
      among children and adolescents, with attention to separation anxiety disorder, 
      social phobia disorder (social anxiety disorder), panic disorder, and generalized 
      anxiety disorder. Comprehensive assessment of child and adolescent anxiety disorders 
      benefits from a multimethod approach to evaluation and diagnosis, including 
      semistructured interviews; child and informant questionnaires; collateral 
      information from parents, teachers, pediatricians, and school psychologists; and 
      behavioral observations. Because anxiety symptoms can include avoidance behaviors, 
      somatic complaints, social difficulties, and sleep disturbances, consideration of a 
      differential diagnosis is important. Among the available psychosocial interventions, 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure-based therapies have emerged as the 
      most well-established treatment approaches for addressing anxiety disorders among 
      children and adolescents. Pharmacologically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIs) have been established to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of 
      pediatric anxiety and are considered the medications of choice for this population. 
      Research indicates that CBT plus SSRI medication is the most effective treatment of 
      anxiety for youths ages seven to 17, compared with either CBT or medication alone. 
      Medication monotherapy and CBT monotherapy have also been demonstrated to be 
      effective treatments.

AB  - Collaborative empiricism, which involves a systemic process of therapist and patient 
      working together to establish common goals in treatment, has been found to be one of 
      the primary change agents in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This article 
      focuses on the development of a therapeutic relationship and implementation of 
      collaborative empiricism along with the elements that lead to success in treatment. 
      This method is used to uncover patients' automatic thoughts and underlying beliefs 
      in treating an array of emotional and behavioral disorders. The role of the 
      therapist is discussed in developing, promoting, and maintaining therapeutic 
      collaboration and what is constituted by the empirical process. A case study 
      illustrates the use of collaborative empiricism with a patient suffering from panic 
      disorder. The article concludes with a series of clinical practices that will 
      enhance collaborative empiricism and collaboration in CBT, and thereby treatment 
      outcomes.

      Study Design.
PG  - 252-69
LID - 10.13109/zptm.2016.62.3.252 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Anxiety disorders, most notably panic disorders and agoraphobia, are 
      common mental disorders, and there is a high comorbidity with personality disorders. 
      Randomized controlled trails addressing this highly relevant group of patients are 
      missing. DESIGN: The multicenter Anxiety and Personality Disorders (APD) study 
      investigates 200 patients with panic disorder and/or agoraphobia with comorbid 
      personality disorder in a randomized control-group comparison of psychoanalytic 
      therapy (PT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), including 100 patients in each 
      group. Each patient will be examined over a period of six years, regardless of the 
      duration of the individual treatment. The main issues that are addressed in this 
      study are the comparison of the efficacy of PT and CBT in this special patient 
      population, the comparison of the sustainability of the effects of PT and CBT, the 
      comparison of the long-term cost-benefit-ratios of PT and CBT as well as the 
      investigation of prescriptive patient characteristics for individualized treatment 
      recommendations (differential indication). DISCUSSION: The APD study compares 
      efficacy, sustainability, and cost-benefit-ratios of CBT and PT for anxiety plus 
      personality disorders in a randomized controlled trail. The study design meets the 
      requirements for an efficacy study for PT, which were recently defined. TRIAL

TI  - SECOND-STAGE TREATMENTS FOR RELATIVE NONRESPONDERS TO COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY 
      (CBT) FOR PANIC DISORDER WITH OR WITHOUT AGORAPHOBIA-CONTINUED CBT VERSUS SSRI: A 
      RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.
PG  - 392-9
LID - 10.1002/da.22457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy are efficacious 
      for the short-term treatment of panic disorder. Less is known about the efficacy of 
      these therapies for individuals who do not respond fully to short-term CBT. METHOD: 
      The current trial is a second-step stratified randomized design comparing two 
      treatment conditions-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; paroxetine or 
      citalopram; n = 34) and continued CBT (n = 24)-in a sample of individuals classified 
      as treatment nonresponders to an initial course of CBT for panic disorder. 
      Participants were randomized to 3 months of treatment and then followed for an 
      additional 9 months. Only treatment responders after 3 months were maintained on the 
      treatment until 12-month follow-up. Data analysis focused on panic disorder symptoms 
      and achievement of response status across the first 3 months of treatment. Final 
      follow-up data are presented descriptively. RESULTS: Participants in the SSRI 
      condition showed significantly lower panic disorder symptoms as compared to 
      continued CBT at 3 months. Results were similar when excluding individuals with 
      comorbid major depression or analyzing the entire intent-to-treat sample. Group 
      differences disappeared during 9-month naturalistic follow-up, although there was 
      significant attrition and use of nonstudy therapies in both arms. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      data suggest greater improvement in panic disorder symptoms when switching to SSRI 
      after failure to fully respond to an initial course of CBT. Future studies should 
      further investigate relapse following treatment discontinuation for nonresponders 
      who became responders. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000368;

TI  - A Critical Review of Negative Affect and the Application of CBT for PTSD.
PG  - 176-194
LID - 10.1177/1524838016650188 [doi]
AB  - Forms of cognitive and behavioral therapies (CBTs), including prolonged exposure and 
      cognitive processing therapy, have been empirically validated as efficacious 
      treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the assumption that 
      PTSD develops from dysregulated fear circuitry possesses limitations that detract 
      from the potential efficacy of CBT approaches. An analysis of these limitations may 
      provide insight into improvements to the CBT approach to PTSD, beginning with an 
      examination of negative affect as an essential component to the conceptualization of 
      PTSD and a barrier to the implementation of CBT for PTSD. As such, the literature 
      regarding the impact of negative affect on aspects of cognition (i.e., attention, 
      processing, memory, and emotion regulation) necessary for the successful application 
      of CBT was systematically reviewed. Several literature databases were explored 
      (e.g., PsychINFO and PubMed), resulting in 25 articles that met criteria for 
      inclusion. Results of the review indicated that high negative affect generally 
      disrupts cognitive processes, resulting in a narrowed focus on stimuli of a negative 
      valence, increased rumination of negative autobiographical memories, inflexible 
      preservation of initial information, difficulty considering counterfactuals, 
      reliance on emotional reasoning, and misinterpretation of neutral or ambiguous 
      events as negative, among others. With the aim to improve treatment efficacy of CBT 
      for PTSD, suggestions to incorporate negative affect into research and clinical 
      contexts are discussed.

AB  - Exposure-based cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders is an 
      effective intervention, but the brain mechanisms driving recovery are largely 
      unknown. In this experimental medicine study, we investigated to what degree CBT 
      affects neural markers of anxiety at an early stage of treatment, to identify 
      dynamic mechanistic changes which might be crucial in the process of recovery as 
      opposed to those seen following full treatment completion. In a randomised 
      controlled trial, unmedicated patients with panic disorder either received four 
      weekly sessions of exposure-based CBT (N = 14) or were allocated to a waiting group 
      (N = 14). Symptom severity was measured before and after the intervention. During 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), patients performed an emotion 
      regulation task, either viewing negative images naturally, or intentionally 
      down-regulating negative affect using previously taught strategies. Four-session CBT 
      led to marked reductions in symptoms and 71% of patients reached recovery status 
      (versus 7% in the control group). This intervention normalised brain hyperactivation 
      previously seen in panic disorder, particularly in areas linked to threat 
      monitoring, fear memory, and maladaptive emotion regulation, such as amygdala, 
      dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and temporal gyrus. Our findings 
      suggest that optimal treatment doses for panic disorder might be much lower than 
      previously thought. Furthermore, this is the first study to show that neural markers 
      of anxiety change very early during CBT, highlighting potential neural mechanisms 
      that might drive clinical recovery. Such knowledge is important for the development 
      of more compact combination treatments targeting these mechanisms more effectively.

TI  - Treatment of post-traumatic psychiatric disorders: A continuum of immediate, 
      post-immediate and follow-up care mediated by specific psychotherapeutic principles. 
      Clinical experience in French-speaking countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People who witness a horrific event are at risk of suffering from acute 
      psychological disorders, potentially leading to chronic post-traumatic symptoms and 
      severe medico-psycho-social complications. Traumatised individuals suffer from 
      psychological damage that is initially indescribable: they are often unable to ask 
      for care in the immediate aftermath of an event. Afterwards, traumatic events and 
      their post-traumatic consequences are still often hidden or minimised by patients 
      for reasons linked to the disorder itself (inexpressibility, shame, depressive 
      thoughts, fear of stigmatisation, etc.). The provision of the initial stage of care 
      has a major impact on the long-term prognosis. Although official French 
      recommendations remain vague, and scientific studies lack power, there is a 
      developing professional consensus on practices, and developments in neurobiology are 
      opening up new opportunities to validate them. OBJECTIVE: Drawing upon our clinical 
      experience and clinical principles provided by our mentors, our aim is to clarify 
      the phases of psychotherapeutic treatment, and we describe three practices: 
      immediate care ("defusing"), post-immediate care ("French debriefing" or 
      "post-immediate psychotherapeutic intervention") and follow-up care ("deferred 
      debriefing" and psychotherapy). Although the international literature considers 
      these phases as separate, here we describe a continuity of talking therapies that 
      support long-term remission. RESULTS: The effectiveness of the combination of 
      immediate, post-immediate and follow-up care has been confirmed by events 
      surrounding the recent Paris and Nice attacks. Specific psychotherapeutic principles 
      are unrelated to a particular school of psychotherapy (notably cognitive and 
      behavioural therapies, analytical therapies, various forms of hypnosis, and 
      eye-movement therapies, etc.). Instead, they refer to specific principles that are 
      effective in the treatment of post-traumatic psychiatric disorders. By helping the 
      individual to verbalise their experience, talking re-establishes dissociated 
      psychological functions. A process of reconsolidation enables sensory memory to be 
      integrated into verbal memory. Supported by psychotherapy, language can be used to 
      discover, or construct, a new sense of meaning for the individual. CONCLUSION: A 
      single session of post-immediate or deferred debriefing has been found to have a 
      miraculous effect on post-traumatic symptoms, confirmed by follow-up. When disorders 
      are chronic and complex, however, treatment can last several months or years. In 
      each case, although certain therapeutic principles are key, other psychotherapeutic 
      and pharmacological treatments should be adapted to the individual's clinical 
      situation, and the symptoms they present.

TI  - A mobile application for panic disorder and agoraphobia: Insights from a 
      multi-methods feasibility study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (PD) is a common 
      psychological disorder. Internet-based interventions have the potential to offer 
      highly scalable low-threshold evidence-based care to people suffering from PD. 
      GET.ON Panic is a newly developed internet-based intervention addressing symptoms of 
      PD. In order to transfer the training into the daily life of the individuals, we 
      integrated mobile components in the training and created a so-called hybrid online 
      training. The development and beta-testing of such a training requires a novel 
      interdisciplinary approach between IT specialists and psychologists. From this point 
      of view, we would like to share our experiences in this exploratory paper. METHODS: 
      This initial feasibility study (N = 10) offers, on the one hand, a brief overview of 
      the interdisciplinary development phase of the mobile application and on the other 
      hand, provides first insights into the usage, usability and acceptance of this 
      mobile application using qualitative interview data as well quantitative measures of 
      8 completing participants. For these reasons, we used a pre-posttest design without 
      a control group. Furthermore, we present initial clinical outcomes of the 
      intervention on e.g. panic symptom severity, depressive symptoms as well additional 
      anxiety measures. Finally, we end with implications for further research in the 
      relatively new field of mobile mental health. RESULTS: Overall, usability, user 
      satisfaction, motivational value and technology acceptance of the app were perceived 
      as high. The usage of app components was diverse: The use of interoceptive exposure 
      exercises and daily summaries on anxiety and mood was highest while using in-vivo 
      exposure exercises and monitoring panic symptoms was perceived as difficult. 
      Furthermore, participants showed after the training less clinical symptoms as at 
      baseline-assessment. DISCUSSION: The current feasibility study contributes to an 
      in-depth understanding of the potential of mobile technology in e-mental health. 
      Overall, the GET.ON Panic app appears to be an acceptable and motivational part of a 
      CBT-based hybrid online training for PD that has the potential to promote training 
      success. After some suggested adjustments have been made, the efficacy should be 
      investigated in a randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Does cognitive behavioral therapy alter mental defeat and cognitive flexibility in 
      patients with panic disorder?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mental defeat and cognitive flexibility have been studied as explanatory 
      factors for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. This study examined mental 
      defeat and cognitive flexibility scores in patients with panic disorder (PD) before 
      and after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and compared them to those of a 
      gender- and age-matched healthy control group. RESULTS: Patients with PD (n = 15) 
      received 16 weekly individual CBT sessions, and the control group (n = 35) received 
      no treatment. Patients completed the Mental Defeat Scale and the Cognitive 
      Flexibility Scale before the intervention, following eight CBT sessions, and 
      following 16 CBT sessions, while the control group did so only prior to receiving 
      CBT (baseline). The patients' pre-CBT Mental Defeat and Cognitive Flexibility Scale 
      scores were significantly higher on the Mental Defeat Scale and lower on the 
      Cognitive Flexibility Scale than those of the control group participants were. In 
      addition, the average Mental Defeat Scale scores of the patients decreased 
      significantly, from 22.2 to 12.4, while their average Cognitive Flexibility Scale 
      scores increased significantly, from 42.8 to 49.5. These results suggest that CBT 
      can reduce mental defeat and increase cognitive flexibility in patients with PD 
      Trial registration The study was registered retrospectively in the national UMIN 
      Clinical Trials Registry on June 10, 2016 (registration ID: UMIN000022693).

TI  - Does prior traumatization affect the treatment outcome of CBT for panic disorder? 
      The potential role of the MAOA gene and depression symptoms.
PG  - 161-170
LID - 10.1007/s00406-017-0823-9 [doi]
AB  - Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is highly effective in the treatment of 
      anxiety disorders, many patients still do not benefit. This study investigates 
      whether a history of traumatic event experience is negatively associated with 
      outcomes of CBT for panic disorder. The moderating role of the monoamine oxidase A 
      (MAOA) gene and depression symptoms as well as the association between trauma 
      history and fear reactivity as a potential mechanism are further analyzed. We 
      conducted a post-hoc analysis of 172 male and 60 female patients with panic disorder 
      treated with CBT in a multi-center study. Treatment outcome was assessed at 
      post-treatment using self-report and clinician rating scales. Fear reactivity before 
      treatment was assessed via heart rate and self-reported anxiety during a behavioral 
      avoidance test. Among females, we did not find any differences in treatment response 
      between traumatized and non-traumatized individuals or any two-way interaction 
      trauma history × MAOA genotype. There was a significant three-way interaction trauma 
      history × MAOA genotype × depression symptoms on all treatment outcomes indicating 
      that in traumatized female patients carrying the low-activity allele, treatment 
      effect sizes decreased with increasing depression symptoms at baseline. No such 
      effects were observed for males. In conclusion, we found no evidence for a 
      differential treatment response in traumatized and non-traumatized individuals. 
      There is preliminary evidence for poorer treatment outcomes in a subgroup of female 
      traumatized individuals carrying the low-active variant of the MAOA gene. These 
      patients also report more symptoms of depression symptomatology and exhibit a 
      dampened fear response before treatment which warrants further investigation.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy effects on alerting network activity and effective 
      connectivity in panic disorder.
PG  - 587-598
LID - 10.1007/s00406-018-0945-8 [doi]
AB  - Given the particular relevance of arousal and alerting in panic disorder (PD), here 
      the alerting network was investigated (1) contrasting patients with PD and healthy 
      controls, (2) as a function of anxiety sensitivity constituting a dimensional 
      measure of panic-related anxiety, and (3) as a possible correlate of treatment 
      response. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 45 out-patients with 
      PD (f = 34) and 51 matched healthy controls were investigated for brain activation 
      patterns and effective connectivity (Dynamic Causal Modeling, DCM) while performing 
      the Attention Network Task (ANT). Anxiety sensitivity was ascertained by the Anxiety 
      Sensitivity Index (ASI). Forty patients and 48 controls were re-scanned after a 
      6 weeks cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) or an equivalent waiting time, 
      respectively. In the alerting condition, patients showed decreased activation in 
      fronto-parietal pathways including the middle frontal gyrus and the superior 
      parietal lobule (MFG, SPL). In addition, ASI scores were negatively correlated with 
      connectivity emerging from the SPL, the SFB and the LC and going to the MFG in 
      patients but not in healthy controls. CBT resulted in an increase in middle frontal 
      and parietal activation along with increased connectivity going from the MFG to the 
      SPL. This change in connectivity was positively correlated with reduction in ASI 
      scores. There were no changes in controls. The present findings point to a 
      pathological disintegration of the MFG in a fronto-parietal pathway in the alerting 
      network in PD which was observed to be reversible by a successful CBT intervention.

TI  - Prediction and moderation of improvement in cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic 
      psychotherapy for panic disorder.
PG  - 803-813
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000224 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify variables predicting psychotherapy outcome for panic disorder 
      or indicating which of 2 very different forms of psychotherapy-panic-focused 
      psychodynamic psychotherapy (PFPP) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-would be 
      more effective for particular patients. METHOD: Data were from 161 adults 
      participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) including these 
      psychotherapies. Patients included 104 women; 118 patients were White, 33 were 
      Black, and 10 were of other races; 24 were Latino(a). Predictors/moderators measured 
      at baseline or by Session 2 of treatment were used to predict change on the Panic 
      Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). RESULTS: Higher expectancy for treatment gains 
      (Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire d = -1.05, CI(95%) [-1.50, -0.60]), and later 
      age of onset (d = -0.65, CI(95%) [-0.98, -0.32]) were predictive of greater change. 
      Both variables were also significant moderators: patients with low expectancy of 
      improvement improved significantly less in PFPP than their counterparts in CBT, 
      whereas this was not the case for patients with average or high levels of 
      expectancy. When patients had an onset of panic disorder later in life (≥27.5 years 
      old), they fared as well in PFPP as CBT. In contrast, at low and mean levels of 
      onset age, CBT was the more effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Predictive variables 
      suggest possibly fruitful foci for improvement of treatment outcome. In terms of 
      moderation, CBT was the more consistently effective treatment, but moderators 
      identified some patients who would do as well in PFPP as in CBT, thereby widening 
      empirically supported options for treatment of this disorder. (PsycINFO Database

TI  - Child and Adolescent Adherence With Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety: 
      Predictors and Associations With Outcomes.
PG  - S215-S226
LID - 10.1080/15374416.2017.1310046 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders is effective, but 
      nonadherence with treatment may reduce the benefits of CBT. This study examined (a) 
      four baseline domains (i.e., demographic, youth clinical characteristics, therapy 
      related, family/parent factors) as predictors of youth adherence with treatment and 
      (b) the associations between youth adherence and treatment outcomes. Data were from 
      279 youth (7-17 years of age, 51.6% female; 79.6% White, 9% African American), with 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) diagnoses 
      of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia, 
      who participated in CBT in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study. Adherence 
      was defined in three ways (session attendance, therapist-rated compliance, and 
      homework completion). Multiple regressions revealed several significant predictors 
      of youth adherence with CBT, but predictors varied according to the definition of 
      adherence. The most robust predictors of greater adherence were living with both 
      parents and fewer youth comorbid externalizing disorders. With respect to outcomes, 
      therapist ratings of higher youth compliance with CBT predicted several indices of 
      favorable outcome: lower anxiety severity, higher global functioning, and treatment 
      responder status after 12 weeks of CBT. Number of sessions attended and homework 
      completion did not predict treatment outcomes. Findings provide information about 
      risks for youth nonadherence, which can inform treatment and highlight the 
      importance of youth compliance with participating in therapy activities, rather than 
      just attending sessions or completing homework assignments.

TI  - Mechanisms for reducing low back pain: a mediation analysis of a multifaceted 
      intervention in workers in elderly care.
PG  - 49-58
LID - 10.1007/s00420-018-1350-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A multifaceted workplace intervention consisting of participatory 
      ergonomics, physical training, and cognitive-behavioural training (CBT) has shown 
      effectiveness for reducing low back pain (LBP). However, the mechanisms of action 
      underlying these intervention components are not well understood. METHODS: This was 
      a mediation analysis of a cluster-randomised controlled trial of a multifaceted 
      intervention in 420 workers in elderly care. Mediation analysis was carried out via 
      structural equation modelling. Potential mediators investigated were: fear-avoidance 
      beliefs, perceived muscle strength, use of assistive devices at work and perceived 
      physical exertion at work. LBP outcomes assessed were: days with LBP, LBP intensity 
      and days with bothersome LBP. RESULTS: There were no significant indirect effects of 
      the intervention on LBP outcomes. There were significant effects of the intervention 
      on both fear-avoidance measures [β = - 0.63, 95% CI (1.23, 0.03); β = - 1.03, 95% CI 
      (- 1.70, - 0.34)] and the use of assistive devices [β = - 0.55, 95% CI (- 1.04, 
      - 0.05)], but not on perceived muscle strength [β = - 0.18, 95% CI (- 0.50, 0.13)] 
      or physical exertion [β = - 0.05, 95% CI (- 0.40, 0.31)]. The only potential 
      mediator with a significant effect on LBP outcomes was physical exertion, which had 
      a significant effect on LBP intensity [β = 0.14, 95% CI (0.04, 0.23)]. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A multifaceted intervention consisting of participatory ergonomics, physical 
      training, and CBT was able to decrease fear-avoidance beliefs and increase use of 
      assistive devices in the workplace. However, these changes did not explain the 
      effect of any of the intervention components on days with LBP, LBP intensity and 
      days with bothersome LBP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors and moderators of treatment outcome by 
      comparing immediate face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (FtF-CBT) to a Stepped 
      Care treatment model comprising three steps: Psychoeducation, Internet-delivered 
      CBT, and FtF-CBT for panic disorder (PD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD). METHOD: 
      Patients (N = 173) were recruited from nine public mental health out-patient clinics 
      and randomized to immediate FtF-CBT or Stepped Care treatment. Characteristics 
      related to social functioning, impairment from the anxiety disorder, and comorbidity 
      was investigated as predictors and moderators by treatment format and diagnosis in 
      multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Lower social functioning, higher impairment 
      from the anxiety disorder, and a comorbid cluster C personality disorder were 
      associated with significantly less improvement, particularly among patients with PD. 
      Furthermore, having a comorbid anxiety disorder was associated with a better 
      treatment outcome among patients with PD but not patients with SAD. Patients with a 
      comorbid depression had similar outcomes from the different treatments, but patients 
      without comorbid depression had better outcomes from immediate FtF-CBT compared to 
      guided self-help. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the same patient characteristics appear 
      to be associated with the treatment outcome for CBT provided in low- and 
      high-intensity formats when treated in public mental health care clinics. The 
      findings suggest that patients with lower social functioning and higher impairment 
      from their anxiety disorder benefit less from these treatments and may require more 
      adapted and extensive treatment. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: Identifier: NCT00619138.

TI  - Shame and guilt in social anxiety disorder: effects of cognitive behavior therapy 
      and association with social anxiety and depressive symptoms.
PG  - e61713

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD), characterized by fear of being scrutinized by others, 
      has features that that are closely linked to the concept of shame. Despite this, it 
      remains to be investigated whether shame is elevated in persons with SAD, and if 
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for SAD could reduce shame experience. In the 
      present study, we focused on internal shame, i.e. the type of shame that pertains to 
      how we judge ourselves. Although guilt is distinctly different from shame, we also 
      viewed it as important to investigate its role in SAD as the two emotions are highly 
      correlated. The aim of this study was to investigate: (I) if persons with SAD differ 
      from healthy controls on shame and guilt, (II) if shame, guilt, depressive symptoms, 
      and social anxiety are associated in persons with SAD, and (III) if CBT can reduce 
      internal shame in patients with SAD. Firstly, we conducted a case-control study 
      comparing a sample with SAD (n = 67) with two samples of healthy controls, a main 
      sample (n = 72) and a replication sample (n = 22). Secondly, all participants with 
      SAD were treated with CBT and shame, measured with the Test of Self-Conscious 
      affect, was assessed before and after treatment. The results showed that shame was 
      elevated in person with SAD compared to the control replication sample, but not to 
      the main control sample. In addition, shame, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms 
      were significantly associated among participants with SAD. After CBT, participants 
      with SAD had significantly reduced their shame (Cohen's d = 0.44). Guilt was 
      unrelated to social anxiety. We conclude that shame and social anxiety are 
      associated and that it is likely that persons with SAD are more prone to experience 
      shame than persons without SAD. Also, CBT is associated with shame reduction in the 
      treatment of SAD.

TI  - How do we target the factors that maintain anorexia nervosa? A behaviour change 
      taxonomical analysis.
PG  - 403-410
LID - 10.1080/09540261.2019.1624509 [doi]
AB  - All psychological treatments for anorexia nervosa appear to have equal (albeit 
      modest) effects. This may be explained because they target similar processes. 
      Although different psychological treatments have been developed for anorexia nervosa 
      treatment, their taxonomical components have not been compared. This study undertook 
      a taxonomical analysis of behaviour change techniques (BCTs), using the CALO-RE 
      analysis tool, from the manuals of Enhanced Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT-E), 
      Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA), Family Based 
      Therapy (FBT), Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM), and Focal 
      Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (FPT). The highest number of BCTs were found in FPT 
      (72,5%), and the lowest were in SSCM (30%). The other interventions had a similar 
      range of BCTs which mainly focused on goal planning (FBT (50%), CBT-E (47.5%), 
      MANTRA (42.5%)). Modelling, shaping, and training communication, self-monitoring, 
      and fear arousal were the less commonly used BCTs across manuals. Manualized 
      psychological interventions for people with anorexia nervosa share a substantial 
      number of behaviour change techniques which might explain their similar levels of 
      effectiveness. New strategies may be needed in order to improve outcomes.

AB  - This study tested whether the hormonal stress response to the DEX-CRH test may be 
      predictive of the psychotherapy success for panic disorder (PD). Thirty-four 
      patients diagnosed either with agoraphobia with PD or PD without agoraphobia were 
      subjected to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Patients (pre-therapy) and healthy 
      volunteers were exposed to the DEX-CRH test. Blood samples were taken for cortisol 
      and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) assessment. Established panic-specific 
      questionnaires were handed out for the pre-therapy and post-therapy evaluation of 
      disease severity (with reference to panic beliefs and agoraphobic cognitions, fear 
      of bodily sensations, agoraphobic avoidance behaviour). Repeated measures ANCOVA 
      were conducted for the analysis of the pre-therapy hormonal response, and Pearson's 
      correlation analysis to test for associations with the psychotherapy outcome. Data 
      analyses revealed large effect sizes for CBT in the clinical measures 
      (η(2) ≥ 0.321), main effects of time for cortisol and ACTH with no differences 
      between both groups, and significant associations between cortisol release and 
      agoraphobic cognitions for the patients. PD diagnosis had no impact on the hormonal 
      response. However, those patients with higher cortisol release showed less 
      improvement after CBT (significantly for agoraphobic cognitions). Clinical 
      implications of these findings are the prediction of the therapy success from a 
      potential endocrine correlate whose persistency (if assessed repeatedly) during the 
      treatment may predict (non-)response to the current treatment, possibly representing 
      a decision support for a change in treatment to avoid the continuation of an 
      inefficient treatment.

      cognitive-behavioral therapy in panic disorder with agoraphobia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are a frequent comorbidity of panic disorder with 
      agoraphobia (PD/AG). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PD/AG effectively 
      reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms, irrespective of comorbidities. However, as 
      depressive comorbidities can confound fear circuitry activation (i.e. amygdalae, 
      insulae, anterior cingulate cortex) in PD/AG, we investigated whether comorbid 
      depressive disorders alter neural plasticity following CBT. METHODS: Within a 
      randomized, controlled clinical trial on exposure-based CBT, forty-two PD/AG 
      patients including fifteen (35.7%) with a comorbid depressive disorder (PD/AG + DEP) 
      participated in a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. A 
      differential fear conditioning task was used as probe of interest. A generalized 
      psycho-physiological interaction analysis (gPPI) served to study functional 
      connectivity patterns. RESULTS: After CBT, only PD/AG patients without comorbid 
      depressive disorders (PD/AG-DEP) showed reduced activation in the left inferior 
      frontal gyrus (IFG) extending to the insula. While PD/AG-DEP patients showed 
      enhanced functional connectivity (FC) between the left IFG and subcortical 
      structures (anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and midbrain), PD/AG + DEP patients 
      exhibited increased FC between the left IFG and cortical structures (prefrontal, 
      parietal regions). In both groups, FC decreased following CBT. LIMITATIONS: Primary 
      depressed and medicated patients were excluded. Major depression and dysthymia were 
      collapsed. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced activation in the left IFG, as previously shown in 
      PD/AG, appears to be a specific substrate of CBT effects in PD/AG-DEP patients only. 
      Differential patterns of FC pertaining to fear circuitry networks in patients 
      without depression vs. cognitive networks in patients with comorbid depression may 
      point towards different pathways recruited by CBT as a function of comorbidity.

AB  - This case study describes the course and content of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) 
      for clinical fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) in a breast cancer survivor. The CBT 
      for clinical FCR consisted of seven face-to-face therapy sessions and one telephone 
      session. The primary treatment goal was to reduce FCR severity by modifying 
      cognitive processes and dysfunctional behavior. Assessments of FCR and quality of 
      life were completed by the breast cancer survivor pre-therapy, post-therapy, and at 
      6 and 12 months of post-therapy. In each treatment session, perceived control over 
      FCR was assessed. A clinical nurse specialist participated in evaluation interviews. 
      The patient's perceived control over FCR increased during the therapy, and FCR 
      severity declined to a non-clinical level. This improvement was still evident at the 
      6- and 12-month follow-up assessments and was supported by results for secondary and 
      exploratory outcomes measures. FCR offers a great challenge for health care 
      professionals due to the lack of effective treatment options. This case study shows 
      how clinical FCR can be addressed with CBT and can contribute to the improvement of 
      care for cancer survivors.

TI  - Group schema therapy versus group cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety 
      disorder with comorbid avoidant personality disorder: study protocol for a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 487
LID - 487
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) with comorbid avoidant personality 
      disorder (APD) has a high prevalence and is associated with serious psychosocial 
      problems and high societal costs. When patients suffer from both SAD and APD, the 
      Dutch multidisciplinary guidelines for personality disorders advise offering 
      prolonged cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Recently there is increasing evidence 
      for the effectiveness of schema therapy (ST) for personality disorders such as 
      borderline personality disorder and cluster C personality disorders. Since ST 
      addresses underlying personality characteristics and maladaptive coping strategies 
      developed in childhood, this treatment might be particularly effective for patients 
      with SAD and comorbid APD. To our knowledge, there are no studies comparing CBT with 
      ST in this particular group of patients. This superiority trial aims at comparing 
      the effectiveness of these treatments. As an additional goal, predictors and 
      underlying mechanisms of change will be explored. METHODS/DESIGN: The design of the 
      study is a multicentre two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the 
      treatment effect of group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) will be compared to 
      that of group schema therapy (GST) in a semi-open group format. A total of 128 
      patients aged 18-65 years old will be enrolled. Patients will receive 30 sessions of 
      GCBT or GST during a period of approximately 9 months. Primary outcome measures are 
      the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Self-Report (LSAS-SR) for social anxiety disorder 
      and the newly developed Avoidant Personality Disorder Severity Index (AVPDSI) for 
      avoidant personality disorder. Secondary outcome measures are the MINI section SAD, 
      the SCID-II section APD, the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI-2), the Inventory of 
      Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR), the World Health Organization 
      Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale 
      (DERS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and the Acceptance and Action 
      Questionnaire (AAQ-II). Data will be collected at the start, halfway and at the end 
      of the treatment, followed by measurements at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment. 
      DISCUSSION: The trial will increase our knowledge on the effectiveness and 
      applicability of both treatment modalities for patients suffering from both 
      diagnoses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register: NTR3921 . Registered on 25 
      March 2013.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) improves coping and daily functioning in 
      adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM), but is less effective in reducing 
      pain. This pilot trial evaluated the efficacy of a novel intervention (Fibromyalgia 
      Integrative Training for Teens; FIT Teens) which integrates CBT with specialized 
      neuromuscular exercise training to enhance the effect of treatment on reducing pain 
      and disability. Forty adolescents with JFM (12-18 years) were randomized to CBT-only 
      or FIT Teens. Treatment was conducted in group-based sessions over 8 weeks with 
      assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up (primary end point). 
      Primary outcomes were pain intensity and functional disability. Secondary outcomes 
      were depressive symptoms, fear of movement, and pain catastrophizing. Thirty-six 
      participants (mean age=15.33 years; 90% female) completed the program. Intent to 
      treat analysis was conducted to evaluate differences between the FIT Teens and CBT 
      groups from baseline to 3-month follow-up, controlling for baseline group 
      differences. Participants in the FIT Teens group showed significantly greater 
      decreases in pain than the CBT group. FIT Teens participants also showed significant 
      improvements in disability, but did not differ from CBT-only at the 3-month end 
      point. Results provide preliminary evidence that the FIT Teens intervention provides 
      added benefits beyond CBT in the treatment of JFM, particularly in pain reduction. 
      PERSPECTIVE: Results from this pilot randomized controlled trial of a new combined 
      CBT and specialized neuromuscular exercise intervention (FIT Teens), compared with 
      CBT alone suggested that FIT Teens offers stronger treatment benefits than CBT alone 
      at initial treatment follow-up, especially with respect to the outcome of pain 
      reduction.

TI  - An Experimental Comparison of Techniques: Cognitive Defusion, Cognitive 
      Restructuring, and in-vivo Exposure for Social Anxiety.
PG  - 249-54
LID - 10.1017/S1352465814000630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the primary differences between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 
      (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for anxiety is the approach to 
      managing negative thoughts. CBT focuses on challenging the accuracy of dysfunctional 
      thoughts through cognitive restructuring exercises, whereas ACT attempts to foster 
      acceptance of such thoughts through cognitive defusion exercises. Previous research 
      suggests that both techniques reduce the distress associated with negative thoughts, 
      though questions remain regarding the benefit of these techniques above and beyond 
      exposure to feared stimuli. AIMS: In the present study, we conducted a brief 
      experimental intervention to examine the utility of cognitive defusion + in-vivo 
      exposure, cognitive restructuring + in-vivo exposure, and in-vivo exposure alone in 
      reducing the impact of negative thoughts in patients with social anxiety disorder. 
      METHOD: All participants completed a brief public speaking exposure and those in the 
      cognitive conditions received training in the assigned cognitive technique. 
      Participants returned a week later to complete a second exposure task and 
      self-report measures. RESULTS: All three conditions resulted in similar decreases in 
      discomfort related to negative thoughts. ANOVA models failed to find an interaction 
      between change in accuracy or importance and assignment to condition in predicting 
      decreased distress of negative thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results 
      suggest that changes in perceived importance and accuracy of negative thoughts may 
      not be the mechanisms by which cognitive defusion and cognitive restructuring affect 
      distress in the short-term.

AB  - With a lifetime prevalence of 13% social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is a 
      common and serious condition that should not be played down because of the burden 
      associated with the disorder, an increased suicide rate and the frequent comorbidity 
      with substance abuse disorders. Social phobia is characterized by the excessive and 
      unrealistic fear of being scrutinized or criticized by others. The disorder often 
      begins in adolescence.Symptoms of social phobia can be effectively treated with 
      evidence-based treatment, including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and 
      psychopharmacological medications. In the present paper, treatment recommendations 
      are given, which are based on a systematic review of all available randomized trials 
      for the treatment of social phobia. Among psychological therapies, variants of CBT 
      have been proven to be effective in controlled studies. Selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs) and the selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor 
      (SNRI) venlafaxine are among the drugs of first choice.

TI  - 7q11.23 Duplication Syndrome.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is characterized by 
      distinctive facial features; cardiovascular disease (dilation of the ascending aorta 
      in 46%); neurologic abnormalities (hypotonia, adventitious movements, and abnormal 
      gait and station); speech sound disorders including motor speech disorders 
      (childhood apraxia of speech and/or dysarthria) and phonologic disorders; behavior 
      problems including anxiety disorders (especially social anxiety disorder [social 
      phobia]), selective mutism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 
      oppositional disorders, physical aggression, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD); 
      delayed motor, speech, and social skills in early childhood; and intellectual 
      ability ranging from intellectual disability (~18%) to borderline intellectual 
      ability (~20%) to low average to high average (the remainder). Approximately 30% of 
      individuals with the 7q11.23 duplication have one or more congenital anomalies. 
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is established 
      by detection of a recurrent 1.5- to 1.8-Mb heterozygous duplication of the 
      Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR). MANAGEMENT: Treatment of 
      manifestations: Aortic dilation is treated with beta blocker therapy and/or surgery 
      as needed. Constipation should be aggressively managed at all ages to prevent 
      encopresis and impaction. Address developmental disabilities, including ASD, through 
      early intervention programs (including speech/language therapy, physical therapy, 
      and occupational therapy), special education programs, and vocational training. 
      Address ASD with applied behavior analytic interventions and other empirically 
      supported psychosocial approaches. Address childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or 
      manifestations of this disorder with intensive speech/language therapy to maximize 
      effective oral communication and prevent or limit later language impairment and/or 
      reading disorder. Address emotional and behavioral disorders (aggression, social 
      anxiety, selective mutism) with cognitive-behavioral therapy, applied behavior 
      analysis behavior modification intervention, and psychotropic medications as needed. 
      Surveillance: Routine monitoring of head circumference in infancy. Annual monitoring 
      of aortic diameter (including Z scores in children) and behavior. Annual assessment 
      by occupational and physical therapists and speech and language pathologists until 
      age six years. GENETIC COUNSELING: The 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is transmitted 
      in an autosomal dominant manner. About 27% of probands have an affected parent. When 
      a parent has the 7q11.23 duplication, the risk to each sib of inheriting the 
      duplication is 50%. If the 7q11.23 duplication identified in the proband is not 
      identified in the parents, the risk to sibs is low (<1%) but greater than that of 
      the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism for 
      the duplication. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible 
      using genomic testing that will detect the 7q11.23 duplication; however, it is not 
      possible to reliably predict the phenotype based on the results of such testing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) effectively reduces fatigue directly 
      following treatment in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but little is known 
      about the process of change during and after CBT. DESIGN: Additional analysis of a 
      randomized clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate which psychological factors 
      mediate change in fatigue during and after CBT. METHODS: TREFAMS-CBT studied the 
      effectiveness of a 16-week CBT treatment for MS-related fatigue. Ninety-one patients 
      were randomized (44 to CBT, 47 to the MS-nurse consultations). Mediation during CBT 
      treatment was studied using assessments at baseline, 8 and 16weeks. Mediation of the 
      change in fatigue from post-treatment to follow-up was studied separately using 
      assessments at 16, 26 and 52weeks. Proposed mediators were: changes in illness 
      cognitions, general self-efficacy, coping styles, daytime sleepiness, concentration 
      and physical activity, fear of disease progression, fatigue perceptions, depression 
      and physical functioning. Mediators were separately analysed according to the 
      product-of-coefficients approach. Confidence intervals were calculated with a 
      bootstrap procedure. RESULTS: During treatment the decrease in fatigue brought on by 
      CBT was mediated by improved fatigue perceptions, increased physical activity, less 
      sleepiness, less helplessness, and improved physical functioning. Post-treatment 
      increases in fatigue levels were mediated by reduced physical activity, reduced 
      concentration, and increased sleepiness. CONCLUSION: These results suggests that 
      focusing on improving fatigue perceptions, perceived physical activity, daytime 
      sleepiness, helplessness, and physical functioning may further improve the 
      effectiveness of CBT for fatigue in patients with MS. Maintenance of treatment 
      effects may be obtained by focusing on improving physical activity, concentration 
      and sleepiness.

TI  - What is the effect on comorbid personality disorder of brief panic-focused 
      psychotherapy in patients with panic disorder?
PG  - 239-247
LID - 10.1002/da.22708 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No studies of psychotherapies for panic disorder (PD) have examined 
      effects on comorbid personality disorders (PersD), yet half such patients have a 
      PersD. METHODS: In a randomized trial for PD with and without agoraphobia comparing 
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy 
      (PFPP), PersD was assessed pre-to-post treatment with the Structured Clinical 
      Interview for the Diagnosis of Axis-II Disorders (SCID-II). For patients completing 
      therapy (n = 118, 54 with PersD), covariance between panic and SCID-II criteria 
      improvements was analyzed. SCID-II diagnostic remission and recovery were evaluated. 
      Comparative efficacy of PFPP versus CBT for improving PersD was analyzed both for 
      the average patient, and as a function of PersD severity. RESULTS: 37 and 17% of 
      PersD patients experienced diagnostic PersD remission and recovery, respectively. 
      Larger reductions in PersD were related to more panic improvement, with a modest 
      effect size (r = 0.28). Although there was no difference between treatments in their 
      ability to improve PersD for the average patient (d = 0.01), patients meeting more 
      PersD criteria did better in PFPP compared to CBT (P = .007), with PFPP being 
      significantly superior at 11 criteria and above (d = 0.66; 3 more criteria lost). 
      CONCLUSIONS: PersD presenting in the context of primary PD rarely resolves during 
      psychotherapies focused on PD, and change in PersD only moderately tracks panic 
      improvements, indicating non-overlap of the constructs. Patients receiving 
      panic-focused psychotherapies may require additional treatment for their PersD. PFPP 
      may be superior at improving severe PersD, but replication of this finding is 
      required.

TI  - Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Children and Adolescents With Dental 
      Anxiety: Open Trial.
PG  - e12
LID - 10.2196/jmir.7803 [doi]
LID - e12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based method for 
      treating specific phobias, but access to treatment is difficult, especially for 
      children and adolescents with dental anxiety. Psychologist-guided Internet-based CBT 
      (ICBT) may be an effective way of increasing accessibility while maintaining 
      treatment effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 
      psychologist-guided ICBT improves school-aged children's and adolescents' ability to 
      manage dental anxiety by (1) decreasing avoidance and affecting the phobia diagnosis 
      and (2) decreasing the dental fear and increasing the target groups' self-efficacy. 
      The study also aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of this novel 
      treatment. METHODS: This was an open, uncontrolled trial with assessments at 
      baseline, posttreatment, and the 1-year follow-up. The study enrolled and treated 18 
      participants. The primary outcome was level of avoidance behaviors, as measured by 
      the picture-guided behavioral avoidance test (PG-BAT). The secondary outcome was a 
      diagnostic evaluation with the parents conducted by a psychologist. The specific 
      phobia section of the structured interview Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders 
      and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL) was used. 
      Other outcome measures included level of dental anxiety and self-efficacy. The ICBT, 
      which employed exposure therapy, comprised 12 modules of texts, animations, 
      dentistry-related video clips, and an exercise package (including dental 
      instruments). Participants accessed the treatment through an Internet-based 
      treatment platform and received Web-based guidance from a psychologist. Treatment 
      also included training at dental clinics. Feasibility and acceptability were 
      assessed by measures of engagement, adherence, compliance, completed measures, 
      patient and parent satisfaction scale, and staff acceptability. RESULTS: The level 
      of avoidance (according to the primary outcome measure PG-BAT) and dental anxiety 
      decreased and self-efficacy increased significantly (P<.001), within-group effect 
      sizes for both the primary outcome (Cohen d=1.5), and other outcomes were large in 
      the range of 0.9 and 1.5. According to K-SADS-PL, 53% (8/15) of the participants 
      were free from diagnosable dental anxiety at the 1-year follow-up. At the 1-year 
      follow-up, improvements were maintained and clinically significant, with 60% (9/15) 
      of participants who had been unable to manage intraoral injection of local 
      anesthetics before ICBT reporting having accomplished this task at a dental clinic. 
      The target group showed improvement in all the outcome measures. High levels of 
      feasibility and acceptability were observed for the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: ICBT is 
      a promising and feasible treatment for dental anxiety in children and adolescents. 
      Integrating it into routine pediatric dental care would increase access to an 
      effective psychological treatment. The results of this open trial must be replicated 
      in controlled studies.

TI  - Pharmacologic Treatment of Pediatric Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - 151-160
AB  - The last decade has seen considerable advances in the treatment of anxiety disorders 
      in children and adolescents and a considerable expansion of the evidence base for 
      psychopharmacologic in this population. The extant data suggest that, for fear-based 
      anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia/social anxiety 
      disorder, and separation anxiety disorder), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIs) and selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) are well 
      tolerated and offer considerable benefit. However, the salutary effects of SSRIs and 
      SSNRIs in pediatric anxiety disorders are consistently amplified by the addition of 
      psychotherapy, particularly in individuals with social anxiety disorder. 
      Additionally, several key demographic and clinical factors, including male sex, 
      non-minority status, and better family functioning and younger age predict greater 
      symptomatic improvement in youth with fear-based anxiety disorders. Thus, current 
      data suggest that in addition to several forms of psychotherapy, including 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), SSRIs and SSNRIs are efficacious in the 
      treatment of these conditions in youth and that CBT + an SSRI may be associated with 
      greater improvement than would be expected with either treatment as monotherapy. 
      Finally, given that some children and adolescents may exhibit partial response to 
      current pharmacotherapies, benzodiazepines, anti-histamines and other agents may 
      have adjunctive roles, despite a lack of data in terms of large, randomized 
      controlled trials.

TI  - Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of telephone-delivered cognitive 
      behavior therapy compared with befriending for treating depression and anxiety in 
      older adults with COPD.
PG  - 327-34
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S100859 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COPD is an umbrella term to describe chronic lung diseases that cause 
      limitations in lung airflow, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The 
      prevalence of depression and anxiety in people with COPD is high, although these 
      comorbidities are often undiagnosed, untreated, or undertreated. There is a need to 
      identify efficacious treatments for depression and anxiety in people with COPD. 
      Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for the treatment of anxiety and depression has a 
      strong evidence base. There has been some success delivering this treatment over the 
      telephone in limited studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 
      both telephone-administered CBT and befriending on outcomes for patients with 
      diagnosed COPD who have at least mild levels of depression and/or anxiety. METHODS: 
      The protocol described in this paper is of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial 
      comparing eight sessions of telephone CBT to an active social control, referred to 
      as befriending. Primary outcome measures will include depression and anxiety 
      symptoms, and secondary outcome measures will include quality of life, 
      self-efficacy, and COPD symptom severity. Participants' satisfaction with the 
      intervention and therapeutic alliance will also be assessed. Measures will be taken 
      pre- and postdelivery of the intervention and again at 8 weeks following the 
      intervention. CONCLUSION: People with COPD often have limitations to their mobility 
      because of their breathlessness. They are often already attending many medical 
      appointments and could be reluctant to attend for face-to-face psychological 
      treatment. The results of this study should identify the relative efficacy of CBT 
      delivered over the telephone to this population, which, if successful, may be a 
      cost-effective and more palatable alternative to face-to-face treatment of 
      depression or anxiety for this population.

AB  - Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be highly effective 
      for a wide range of disorders, many patients do not benefit. The failure to fully 
      benefit from CBT may be due to a wide range of factors, one of which includes 
      "clinical errors" that often occur during the therapeutic process. We briefly note 4 
      such clinical errors including neglecting to conduct a detailed functional analysis 
      of the presenting problem(s), not adequately engaging the patient in developing a 
      case formulation for the purposes of treatment planning, getting wrapped up in 
      simply examining beliefs without behavioral tests, and not holding patients 
      accountable for fear of rupturing the therapeutic alliance. We then discuss the 
      context in which these clinical errors may occur during CBT and highlight 
      alternative approaches. Being mindful of these and other potential clinical errors 
      during CBT may facilitate better treatment outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - BACKGROUND: Learning by conditioning is a key ability of animals and humans for 
      acquiring novel behavior necessary for survival in a changing environment. Aberrant 
      conditioning has been considered a crucial factor in the etiology and maintenance of 
      panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/A). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an 
      effective treatment for PD/A. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects 
      of CBT on conditioning processes in PD/A are unknown. METHODS: In a randomized, 
      controlled, multicenter clinical trial in medication-free patients with PD/A who 
      were treated with 12 sessions of manualized CBT, functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) was used during fear conditioning before and after CBT. 
      Quality-controlled fMRI data from 42 patients and 42 healthy subjects were obtained. 
      RESULTS: After CBT, patients compared to control subjects revealed reduced 
      activation for the conditioned response (CS+ > CS-) in the left inferior frontal 
      gyrus (IFG). This activation reduction was correlated with reduction in agoraphobic 
      symptoms from t1 to t2. Patients compared to control subjects also demonstrated 
      increased connectivity between the IFG and regions of the "fear network" (amygdalae, 
      insulae, anterior cingulate cortex) across time. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates the link between cerebral correlates of cognitive (IFG) and emotional 
      ("fear network") processing during symptom improvement across time in PD/A. Further 
      research along this line has promising potential to support the development and 
      further optimization of targeted treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Among patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it would be 
      helpful to identify those most likely to respond to specific treatments, yet few 
      factors have been identified that reliably predict positive outcome. We sought to 
      identify pretreatment baseline characteristics that associate with gastrointestinal 
      symptom improvement in patients who received empirically validated regimens of 
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or IBS education. METHODS: We analyzed data from 
      the IBS Outcome Study, in which 436 patients with IBS (average age, 41 years; 80%, 
      female) were randomly assigned to groups that received 4 or 10 sessions of cognitive 
      behavior therapy or education over 10 weeks. Baseline data were collected from all 
      participants on sociodemographic and clinical features and comorbidities. 
      Interaction analyses used a modified linear probability model with Huber-White 
      robust estimators to identify baseline factors that moderated as a function of 
      treatment condition GI symptom improvement based on the IBS-version of the Clinical 
      Global Impressions-Improvement Scale. RESULTS: Whether the primary outcome of IBS 
      symptom improvement was rated by patients or physician assessors blind to treatment 
      2 weeks after it ended, higher percentages of patients had symptom improvement after 
      CBT compared with EDU among those with low levels of trait anxiety (71.3% vs 34.9%; 
      P < .05) or anxiety sensitivity (71.7% vs 38.6%; P < .05) and for those with 
      baseline typical levels of trait anxiety (66.0% vs 47.1%; P < .05) or anxiety 
      sensitivity (66.3% vs 47.1%; P < .05). For patients with high trait anxiety or 
      anxiety sensitivity, the difference in percentage of responders to CBT vs EDU was 
      non-significant for trait anxiety (60.6% vs 59.2%) and anxiety sensitivity (60.9% vs 
      55.9%). If patients scored at or below 22 on the Trait Anxiety Inventory, CBT had a 
      statistically significant advantage over EDU. If patients scored at or below 29 on 
      the Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory, there was a statistically significant advantage 
      for CBT vs EDU. CONCLUSIONS: In analyses of outcomes of patients with 
      treatment-refractory IBS, baseline levels of trait anxiety and anxiety sensitivity 
      (fear of arousal symptoms) were associated with improved gastrointestinal symptoms 
      following CBT compared to IBS education. These findings and approaches might be used 
      to optimize selection of treatment for patients with IBS.

TI  - Are children with social anxiety disorder more likely than children with other 
      anxiety disorders to anticipate poor social performance and reflect negatively on 
      their performance?

LID - S0165-0327(18)31353-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2018.11.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cognitive theory of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggests that 
      adults with SAD have a tendency to anticipate poor social performance and reflect 
      negatively on their performance following a social event. While a number of studies 
      with socially anxious adults have supported the role of poor performance 
      anticipation and post-event rumination in SAD, to date, only a few studies have 
      addressed whether this also applies to children with SAD. METHODS: Children (7-12 
      years) diagnosed with SAD (n = 40), other anxious children (n = 40) and non-anxious 
      children (n = 34) were exposed to a social stressor speech task and their pre- and 
      post-performance appraisals assessed, taking into account objective performance 
      ratings. RESULTS: Although observers rated some aspects of performance as 
      significantly worse among children with SAD than children with other anxiety 
      disorders, children with SAD were not more likely than their anxious or non-anxious 
      peers to show a general bias in pre- or post-performance appraisals. Furthermore, 
      children with SAD were just as likely as their anxious and non-anxious peers to 
      recognize good performance but were more critical of themselves when their 
      performance was poor. LIMITATIONS: The speech task did not involve a same-age peer. 
      Participants were relatively affluent group of predominantly non-minority status. 
      Specificity for SAD in relation to other anxiety disorders remains unclear. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on counteracting pre- and post-event social performance 
      appraisals may potentially be inappropriate for childhood SAD. Children with SAD 
      might benefit from interventions that focus on helping them to become less critical 
      of themselves after social interactions have not gone well.

TI  - DNA methylation of FKBP5 and response to exposure-based psychological therapy.
PG  - 150-158
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32650 [doi]
AB  - Differential DNA methylation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis related gene 
      FKBP5 has recently been shown to be associated with varying response to 
      environmental influences and may play a role in how well people respond to 
      psychological treatments. Participants (n = 111) received exposure-based cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) for agoraphobia with or without panic disorder, or 
      specific phobias. Percentage DNA methylation levels were measured for the promoter 
      region and intron 7 of FKBP5. The association between percentage reduction in 
      clinical severity and change in DNA methylation was tested using linear mixed 
      models. The effect of genotype (rs1360780) was tested by the inclusion of an 
      interaction term. The association between change in DNA methylation and FKBP5 
      expression was examined. Change in percentage DNA methylation at one CpG site of 
      intron 7 was associated with percentage reduction in severity (β = -4.26, p = 3.90 × 
      10(-4) ), where a decrease in DNA methylation was associated with greater response 
      to therapy. An interaction was detected between rs1360780 and changes in DNA 
      methylation in the promoter region of FKBP5 on treatment outcome (p = .045) but did 
      not survive correction for multiple testing. Changes in DNA methylation were not 
      associated with FKBP5 expression. Decreasing DNA methylation at one CpG site of 
      intron 7 of FKBP5 was strongly associated with decreasing anxiety severity following 
      exposure-based CBT. In addition, there was suggestive evidence that allele-specific 
      methylation at the promoter region may also be associated with treatment response. 
      The results of this study add to the growing literature demonstrating the role of 
      biological processes such as DNA methylation in response to environmental 
      influences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The research on the association between the working alliance and 
      therapist competence/adherence and outcome from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      is limited and characterized by inconclusive findings. This study investigates the 
      working alliance and competence/adherence as predictors of outcome of CBT for social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). METHOD: Eighty-two clinically 
      referred patients (58.5% female; age: M = 33.6 years, SD = 10.3) with PD (n = 31) or 
      SAD (n = 51) were treated with 12 sessions of manualized CBT by 22 clinicians with 
      limited CBT experience in a randomized controlled effectiveness trial. Independent 
      assessors rated the CBT competence/adherence of the therapists using a revised 
      version of the Cognitive Therapy Adherence and Competence Scale, and the patients 
      rated the quality of the working alliance using the Working Alliance Inventory-short 
      form in therapy sessions 3 and 8. The outcome was assessed by independent assessors 
      as well as by patients self-report. A total of 20.7% of the patients (27.5% SAD, 
      9.7% PD) dropped out during treatment. The association between the alliance, 
      competence/adherence, outcome and dropout was investigated using multiple regression 
      analyses. RESULTS: Higher therapist' competence/adherence early in the therapy was 
      associated with a better outcome among PD patients, lower competence/adherence was 
      associated with dropout among SAD patients. Higher rating of the alliance late in 
      the therapy was associated with a better outcome, whereas lower alliance rating late 
      in the therapy was associated with dropout. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that 
      the therapist competence/adherence and the working alliance have independent 
      contributions to the outcome from CBT for anxiety disorders, but in different phases 
      of the treatment.

TI  - Psychotherapy with Suicidal Patients: The Integrative Psychodynamic Approach of the 
      Boston Suicide Study Group.
LID - 10.3390/medicina55060303 [doi]
LID - 303
AB  - Psychotherapy with suicidal patients is inherently challenging. Psychodynamic 
      psychotherapy focuses attention on the patient's internal experience through the 
      creation of a therapeutic space for an open-ended exploration of thoughts, fears, 
      and fantasies as they emerge through interactive dialogue with an empathic 
      therapist. The Boston Suicide Study Group (M.S., M.J.G., E.R., B.H.), has developed 
      an integrative psychodynamic approach to psychotherapy with suicidal patients based 
      on the authors' extensive clinical work with suicidal patients (over 100 years 
      combined). It is fundamentally psychodynamic in nature, with an emphasis on the 
      therapeutic alliance, unconscious and implicit relational processes, and the power 
      of the therapeutic relationship to facilitate change in a long-term exploratory 
      treatment. It is also integrative, however, drawing extensively on ideas and 
      techniques described in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Mentalization Based 
      Treatment (MBT), Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), as well on developmental and 
      social psychology research. This is not meant to be a comprehensive review of 
      psychodynamic treatment of suicidal patients, but rather a description of an 
      integrative approach that synthesizes clinical experience and relevant theoretical 
      contributions from the literature that support the authors' reasoning. There are ten 
      key aspects of this integrative psychodynamic treatment: 1. Approach to the patient 
      in crisis; 2, instilling hope; 3. a focus on the patient's internal affective 
      experience; 4. attention to conscious and unconscious beliefs and fantasies; 5. 
      improving affect tolerance; 6. development of narrative identity and modification of 
      "relational scripts"; 7. facilitation of the emergence of the patient's genuine 
      capacities; 8. improving a sense of continuity and coherence; 9 attention to the 
      therapeutic alliance; 10. attention to countertransference. The elements of 
      treatment are overlapping and not meant to be sequential, but each is discussed 
      separately as an essential aspect of the psychotherapeutic work. This integrative 
      psychodynamic approach is a useful method for suicide prevention as it helps to 
      instill hope, provides relational contact and engages the suicidal patient in a 
      process that leads to positive internal change. The benefits of the psychotherapy go 
      beyond crisis intervention, and include the potential for improved affect tolerance, 
      more fulfilling relational experiences, emergence of previously warded off 
      experience of genuine capacities, and a positive change in narrative identity.

TI  - CBT intensity and outcome for panic disorder in a primary care setting.
PG  - 112-9
AB  - A hybrid efficacy-effectiveness design in which participants (n = 91/93) were 
      retained in the study regardless of whether or not they received treatment enabled 
      evaluation of CBT intensity in relation to panic disorder in the primary care 
      setting. CBT intensity was operationalized as number of cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      sessions, number of follow-up booster phone calls, and secondarily, as number of 
      cognitive behavioral coping and exposure strategies. Baseline psychosocial and 
      demographic predictors of CBT intensity were analyzed first. Severity of anxiety 
      sensitivity predicted number of cognitive behavioral sessions, but no baseline 
      variables predicted number of follow-up booster phone calls or number of coping and 
      exposure strategies. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to 
      evaluate the degree to which treatment intensity predicted 3-month and 12-month 
      outcomes (anxiety sensitivity, phobic avoidance, depressive symptoms, disability, 
      and medical and mental health functioning) after controlling for potential 
      confounding baseline variables. Number of cognitive behavioral therapy sessions 
      predicted lower anxiety sensitivity at 3 and 12 months, and number of follow-up 
      booster phone calls predicted lower anxiety sensitivity, less phobic avoidance, and 
      less depression at 12 months. These findings indicate that "dose" of psychotherapy 
      was an important predictor of outcome. The significance of follow-up booster phone 
      contact is discussed as an index of continued self-management of panic and anxiety 
      following acute treatment.

TI  - The impact of treatment delivery format on response to cognitive behaviour therapy 
      for preadolescent children with anxiety disorders.
PG  - 763-772
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12872 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several delivery formats of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for child 
      anxiety have been proposed, however, there is little consensus on the optimal 
      delivery format. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the impact of the 
      child's primary anxiety diagnosis on changes in clinical severity (of the primary 
      problem) during individual CBT, group CBT and guided parent-led CBT. The secondary 
      goal was to investigate the impact of the child's primary anxiety diagnosis on rates 
      of remission for the three treatment formats. METHODS: A sample of 1,253 children 
      (5-12 years; Mage = 9.3, SD = 1.7) was pooled from CBT trials carried out at 10 
      sites. Children had a primary diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), 
      social anxiety disorder (SoAD), specific phobia (SP) or separation anxiety disorder 
      (SAD). Children and parents completed a semistructured clinical interview to assess 
      the presence and severity of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders at preintervention, 
      postintervention and follow-up. Linear mixture modelling was used to evaluate the 
      primary research question and logistic modelling was used to investigate the 
      secondary research question. RESULTS: In children with primary GAD, SAD or SoAD, 
      there were no significant differences between delivery formats. However, children 
      with primary SP showed significantly larger reductions in clinical severity 
      following individual CBT compared to group CBT and guided parent-led CBT. The 
      results were mirrored in the analysis of remission responses with the exception that 
      individual CBT was no longer superior to group CBT for children with a primary SP. 
      The difference between individual and group was not significant when follow-up data 
      were examined separately. CONCLUSIONS: Data show there may be greater clinical 
      benefit by allocating children with a primary SP to individual CBT, although future 
      research on cost-effectiveness is needed to determine whether the additional 
      clinical benefits justify the additional resources required.

AB  - The use of D-cycloserine (DCS) as a cognitive enhancer to augment exposure-based 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) represents a promising new translational research 
      direction with the goal to accelerate and optimize treatment response for anxiety 
      disorders. Some studies suggest that DCS may not only augment extinction learning 
      but could also facilitate fear memory reconsolidation. Therefore, the effect of DCS 
      may depend on fear levels reported at the end of exposure sessions. This paper 
      presents the rationale and design for a randomized controlled trial examining the 
      relative efficacy of tailoring DCS administration based on exposure success (i.e. 
      end fear levels) during a 5-session group CBT protocol for social anxiety disorder 
      (n = 156). Specifically, tailored post-session DCS administration will be compared 
      against untailored post-session DCS, untailored pre-session DCS, and pill placebo in 
      terms of reduction in social anxiety symptoms and responder status. In addition, a 
      subset of participants (n = 96) will undergo a fear extinction retention experiment 
      prior to the clinical trial in which they will be randomly assigned to receive 
      either DCS or placebo prior to extinguishing a conditioned fear. The results from 
      this experimental paradigm will clarify the mechanism of the effects of DCS on 
      exposure procedures. This study aims to serve as the first step toward developing an 
      algorithm for the personalized use of DCS during CBT for social anxiety disorder, 
      with the ultimate goal of optimizing treatment outcome for anxiety disorders.

TI  - Efficacy of a transdiagnostic emotion-focused exposure treatment for chronic pain 
      patients with comorbid anxiety and depression: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1708-1718
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001575 [doi]
AB  - The comorbidity between chronic pain and emotional problems has proven difficult to 
      address with current treatment options. This study addresses the efficacy of a 
      transdiagnostic emotion-focused exposure treatment ("hybrid") for chronic pain 
      patients with comorbid emotional problems. Adults (n = 115) with chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain and functional and emotional problems were included in a 
      2-centre, parallel randomized controlled, open-label trial comparing this treatment 
      to an active control condition receiving a guided Internet-delivered pain management 
      treatment based on CBT principles (iCBT). The hybrid treatment (n = 58, 10-16 
      sessions) integrates exposure in vivo for chronic pain based on the fear-avoidance 
      model with an emotion-regulation approach informed by procedures in Dialectical 
      Behavior Therapy. The iCBT (n = 57; 8 treatment modules) addresses topics such as 
      pain education, coping strategies, relaxation, problem solving, stress, and sleep 
      management using standard CBT techniques. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed 
      before and after treatment as well as at a 9-month primary end point. Across 
      conditions, 78% participants completed post-treatment and 81% follow-up assessment. 
      Intent-to-treat analyses showed that the hybrid had a significantly better 
      post-treatment outcome on pain catastrophizing (d = 0.39) and pain interference (d = 
      0.63) and significantly better follow-up outcomes on depression (d = 0.43) and pain 
      interference (d = 0.51). There were no differences on anxiety and pain intensity. 
      Observed proportions of clinically significant improvement favoured the hybrid on 
      all but one comparison, but no statistically significant differences were observed. 
      We conclude that the hybrid emotion-focused treatment may be considered an 
      acceptable, credible, and efficacious treatment option for chronic pain patients 
      with comorbid emotional problems.

TI  - Partner-related attachment as a moderator of outcome in patients with social anxiety 
      disorder-a comparison between short-term cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic 
      therapy.
PG  - 339-350
LID - 10.1037/pst0000129 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated whether partner-related attachment characteristics 
      differentially predict premature treatment termination as well as posttreatment and 
      1-year follow-up outcome in patients with social anxiety disorder treated with a 
      manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or short-term psychodynamic therapy 
      (PDT) in the SOPHO-NET (Social Phobia Psychotherapy Network) trial. Participants 
      were 412 patients with social anxiety disorder (57% female) with a mean age of 35.4 
      years (SD = 12.1) who were randomized to either CBT or PDT. Partner-related 
      attachment characteristics were measured using the revised Experiences in Close 
      Relationships Questionnaire (ECR-R) at pretreatment. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety 
      Scale was administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and a 1-year follow-up. To 
      address our research questions, linear regression models were applied. Furthermore, 
      we compared CBT versus PDT patients within ECR-R quartiles. Treatment dropout did 
      not differ between CBT and PDT and was not predicted by pretreatment attachment. In 
      both treatment conditions, there was a trend for higher attachment anxiety to be 
      associated with a more limited reduction in symptoms if controlling for pretreatment 
      Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores. Exploratory analyses showed that patients 
      assigned to the highest quartile of the ECR-R-Avoidance distribution showed more 
      benefit within the CBT condition posttreatment and at follow-up than the PDT 
      condition. Our findings suggest that it may be useful to assess attachment 
      characteristics in patients with social anxiety disorder before psychotherapeutic 
      treatment. Patients characterized by very high pretreatment attachment avoidance 
      (ECR-R-Avoidance >3.87) may specifically benefit more from CBT than from PDT. 
      However, replication studies are needed that also should investigate nonlinear 
      effects of pretreatment attachment. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Trauma-focused CBT for youth who experience ongoing traumas.
PG  - 637-46
LID - 10.1016/j.chiabu.2011.05.002 [doi]
AB  - Many youth experience ongoing trauma exposure, such as domestic or community 
      violence. Clinicians often ask whether evidence-based treatments containing exposure 
      components to reduce learned fear responses to historical trauma are appropriate for 
      these youth. Essentially the question is, if youth are desensitized to their trauma 
      experiences, will this in some way impair their responding to current or ongoing 
      trauma? The paper addresses practical strategies for implementing one evidence-based 
      treatment, Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) for youth with 
      ongoing traumas. Collaboration with local therapists and families participating in 
      TF-CBT community and international programs elucidated effective strategies for 
      applying TF-CBT with these youth. These strategies included: (1) enhancing safety 
      early in treatment; (2) effectively engaging parents who experience personal ongoing 
      trauma; and (3) during the trauma narrative and processing component focusing on (a) 
      increasing parental awareness and acceptance of the extent of the youths' ongoing 
      trauma experiences; (b) addressing youths' maladaptive cognitions about ongoing 
      traumas; and (c) helping youth differentiate between real danger and generalized 
      trauma reminders. Case examples illustrate how to use these strategies in diverse 
      clinical situations. Through these strategies TF-CBT clinicians can effectively 
      improve outcomes for youth experiencing ongoing traumas.

TI  - Baseline Patient Characteristics Predicting Outcome and Attrition in Cognitive 
      Therapy for Social Phobia: Results from a Large Multicentre Trial.
PG  - 35-46
LID - 10.1002/cpp.1936 [doi]
AB  - We examined the role of baseline patient characteristics as predictors of outcome 
      (end-state functioning, response and remission) and attrition for cognitive therapy 
      (CT) in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Beyond socio-demographic and clinical 
      variables such as symptom severity and comorbidity status, previously neglected 
      patient characteristics (e.g., personality, self-esteem, shame, interpersonal 
      problems and attachment style) were analysed. METHOD: Data came from the CT arm of a 
      multicentre RCT with n = 244 patients having DSM-IV SAD. CT was conducted according 
      to the manual by Clark and Wells. Severity of SAD was assessed at baseline and end 
      of treatment with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Multiple linear 
      regression analyses and logistic regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Up to 
      37% of the post-treatment variance (LSAS) could be explained by all pre-treatment 
      variables combined. Symptom severity (baseline LSAS) was consistently negatively 
      associated with end-state functioning and remission, but not with response. Number 
      of comorbid diagnoses was negatively associated with end-state functioning and 
      response, but not with remission. Self-esteem was positively associated with higher 
      end-state functioning and more shame with better response. Attrition could not be 
      significantly predicted. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the initial 
      probability for treatment success mainly depends on severity of disorder and 
      comorbid conditions while other psychological variables are of minor importance, at 
      least on a nomothetic level. This stands in contrast with efforts to arrive at an 
      empirical-based foundation for differential indication and argues to search for more 
      potent moderators of therapeutic change rather on the process level. KEY 
      PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Personality, self-esteem, shame, attachment style and 
      interpersonal problems do not or only marginally moderate the effects of 
      interventions in CT of social phobia. Symptom severity and comorbid diagnoses might 
      affect treatment outcome negatively. Beyond these two factors, most patients share a 
      similar likelihood of treatment success when treated according to the manual by 
      Clark and Wells. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Increased error monitoring, as measured by the error-related negativity (ERN), has 
      been shown to persist after treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth and 
      adults; however, no previous studies have examined the ERN following treatment for 
      related anxiety disorders. We used a flanker task to elicit the ERN in 28 youth and 
      young adults (8-26years old) with primary diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder 
      (GAD) or social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 35 healthy controls. Patients were 
      assessed before and after treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and healthy controls were assessed 
      at a comparable interval. The ERN increased across assessments in the combined 
      sample. Patients with SAD exhibited an enhanced ERN relative to healthy controls 
      prior to and following treatment, even when analyses were limited to SAD patients 
      who responded to treatment. Patients with GAD did not significantly differ from 
      healthy controls at either assessment. Results provide preliminary evidence that 
      enhanced error monitoring persists following treatment for SAD in youth and young 
      adults, and support conceptualizations of increased error monitoring as a trait-like 
      vulnerability that may contribute to risk for recurrence and impaired functioning 
      later in life. Future work is needed to further evaluate the ERN in GAD across 
      development, including whether an enhanced ERN develops in adulthood or is most 
      apparent when worries focus on internal sources of threat.

      Setting.
PG  - 5825067

LID - 5825067
AB  - AIM: Purpose of this practice and data-based study was to evaluate the outcome of 
      dental fear treatment of patients referred to the Clinic for Fearful Dental Patients 
      (CFDP) in the primary oral health care, City of Oulu, Finland, during period 
      2000-2005. METHODS: A psychological approach including behavioral interventions and 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (BT/CBT) was used for all participants combined with 
      conscious sedation or dental general anesthesia (DGA), if needed. The outcome was 
      considered successful if later dental visits were carried out without any 
      notifications in the patient records of behavioral problems or sedation. Data 
      collection was made in 2006; the average length of the observation period from the 
      last visit in the CFPD to data collection was 2 y 3 m (SD 1 y 5 m). All information 
      was available for 163 patients (mean age 8.9 y at referral). Study population was 
      dominated by males (58.0%). Cause for referrals was mostly dental fear (81.0%) or 
      lack of cooperation. RESULTS: The success rate was 69.6% among females and 68.1% 
      among males. Success seemed to be (p=0.053) higher for those treated in ≤12 years 
      compared with the older ones. The participants, without need for dental general 
      anesthesia (DGA) in the CFDP, had significantly a higher success rate (81.4%) 
      compared with those who did (54.8%, p < 0.001). Use of conscious oral sedation 
      (p=0.300) or N(2)O (p=0.585) was not associated with the future success. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A chair-side approach seems successful in a primary health care setting 
      for treating dental fear, especially in early childhood. Use of sedation seems not 
      to improve the success rate.

      disorders. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis wherein we searched electronic 
      databases and references to select randomized controlled studies comparing CBT and 
      pharmacotherapy, with or without placebo, in adults with major depressive or anxiety 
      disorders. The primary effect size was calculated from disorder-specific outcome 
      measures as the difference between CBT and pharmacotherapy outcomes (i.e., positive 
      effect size favors CBT; negative effect size favors pharmacotherapy). RESULTS: 
      Twenty-one anxiety (N = 1,266) and twenty-one depression (N = 2,027) studies 
      comparing medication to CBT were included. Including all anxiety disorders, the 
      overall effect size was.25 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.55, P =.07). Effects for panic disorder 
      significantly favored CBT over medications (.50, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.98). 
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder showed similar effects-sizes, though not statistically 
      significant (.49, 95% CI: -0.11, 1.09). Medications showed a nonsignificant 
      advantage for social anxiety disorder (-.22, 95% CI: -0.50, 0.06). The overall 
      effect size for depression studies was.05 (95% CI: -0.09, 0.19), with no advantage 
      for medications or CBT. Pooling anxiety disorder and depression studies, the omnibus 
      comparison of the relative difference between anxiety and depression in 
      effectiveness for CBT versus pharmacotherapy pointed to a nonsignificant advantage 
      for CBT in anxiety versus depression (B =.14, 95% CI: -0.14, 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: On 
      balance, the evidence presented here indicates that there are at most very modest 
      differences in effects of CBT versus pharmacotherapy in the treatment of anxiety 
      versus depressive disorders. There seems to be larger differences between the 
      anxiety disorders in terms of their relative responsiveness to pharmacotherapy 
      versus CBT.

TI  - Psychotherapies for Panic Disorder: A Tale of Two Sites.
PG  - 927-35
LID - 10.4088/JCP.14m09507 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), panic-focused 
      psychodynamic psychotherapy (PFPP), and applied relaxation training (ART) for 
      primary DSM-IV panic disorder with and without agoraphobia in a 2-site randomized 
      controlled trial. METHOD: 201 patients were stratified for site and DSM-IV 
      agoraphobia and depression and were randomized to CBT, PFPP, or ART (19-24 sessions) 
      over 12 weeks in a 2:2:1 ratio at Weill Cornell Medical College (New York, New York) 
      and University of Pennsylvania ("Penn"; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Any medication 
      was held constant. RESULTS: Attrition rates were ART, 41%; CBT, 25%; and PFPP, 22%. 
      The most symptomatic patients were more likely to drop out of ART than CBT or PFPP 
      (P = .013). Outcome analyses revealed site-by-treatment interactions in speed of 
      Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) change over time (P = .013). At Cornell, no 
      differences emerged on improvement on the primary outcome, estimated speed of change 
      over time on the PDSS; at Penn, ART (P = .025) and CBT (P = .009) showed greater 
      improvement at treatment termination than PFPP. A site-by-treatment interaction (P = 
      .016) for a priori-defined response (40% PDSS reduction) showed significant 
      differences at Cornell: ART 30%, CBT 65%, PFPP 71% (P = .007), but not at Penn: ART 
      63%, CBT 60%, PFPP 48% (P = .37). Penn patients were more symptomatic, differed 
      demographically from Cornell patients, had a 7.2-fold greater likelihood of taking 
      medication, and had a 28-fold greater likelihood of taking benzodiazepines. However, 
      these differences did not explain site-by-treatment interactions. CONCLUSIONS: All 
      treatments substantially improved panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, but 
      patients, particularly the most severely ill, found ART less acceptable. CBT showed 
      the most consistent performance across sites; however, the results for PFPP showed 
      the promise of psychodynamic psychotherapy for this disorder. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Long-Term Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Videoconference-Delivered 
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, and 
      Social Anxiety Disorder in Japan: One-Year Follow-Up of a Single-Arm Trial.
PG  - e17157
LID - 10.2196/17157 [doi]
LID - e17157
AB  - BACKGROUND: Face-to-face individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and 
      internet-based CBT (ICBT) without videoconferencing are known to have long-term 
      effectiveness for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), and 
      social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, videoconference-delivered CBT (VCBT) has not 
      been investigated regarding its long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term effectiveness 
      and cost-effectiveness of VCBT for patients with OCD, PD, or SAD in Japan via a 
      1-year follow-up to our previous 16-week single-arm study. METHODS: Written informed 
      consent was obtained from 25 of 29 eligible patients with OCD, PD, and SAD who had 
      completed VCBT in our clinical trial. Participants were assessed at baseline, end of 
      treatment, and at the follow-up end points of 3, 6, and 12 months. Outcomes were the 
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Panic Disorder Severity Scale 
      (PDSS), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
      (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L). To 
      analyze long-term effectiveness, we used mixed-model analysis of variance. To 
      analyze cost-effectiveness, we employed relevant public data and derived data on 
      VCBT implementation costs from Japanese national health insurance data. RESULTS: 
      Four males and 21 females with an average age of 35.1 (SD 8.6) years participated in 
      the 1-year follow-up study. Principal diagnoses were OCD (n=10), PD (n=7), and SAD 
      (n=8). The change at 12 months on the Y-BOCS was -4.1 (F(1)=4.45, P=.04), the change 
      in PDSS was -4.4 (F(1)=6.83, P=.001), and the change in LSAS was -30.9 (F(1)=6.73, 
      P=.01). The change in the PHQ-9 at 12 months was -2.7 (F(1)=7.72, P=.007), and the 
      change in the GAD-7 was -3.0 (F(1)=7.09, P=.009). QALY at 12 months was 0.7469 (SE 
      0.0353, 95% Cl 0.6728-0.821), and the change was a significant increase of 0.0379 
      (P=.01). Total costs to provide the VCBT were ¥60,800 to ¥81,960 per patient. The 
      set threshold was ¥189,500 ($1723, €1579, and £1354) calculated based on willingness 
      to pay in Japan. CONCLUSIONS: VCBT was a cost-effective way to effectively treat 
      Japanese patients with OCD, PD, or SAD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: University Hospital

TI  - Competence and Adherence Scale for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CAS-CBT) for 
      anxiety disorders in youth: Psychometric properties.
PG  - 908-16
LID - 10.1037/pas0000230 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the 
      Competence and Adherence Scale for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CAS-CBT). The 
      CAS-CBT is an 11-item scale developed to measure adherence and competence in 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders in youth. A total of 181 
      videotapes from the treatment sessions in a randomized controlled effectiveness 
      trial (Wergeland et al., 2014) comprising youth (N = 182, M age = 11.5 years, SD = 
      2.1, range 8-15 years, 53% girls, 90.7% Caucasian) with mixed anxiety disorders were 
      assessed with the CAS-CBT to investigate interitem correlations, internal 
      consistency, and factor structure. Internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha = 
      .87). Factor analysis suggested a 2-factor solution with Factor 1 representing CBT 
      structure and session goals (explaining 46.9% of the variance) and Factor 2 
      representing process and relational skills (explaining 19.7% of the variance). The 
      sum-score for adherence and competence was strongly intercorrelated, r = .79, p < 
      .001. Novice raters (graduate psychology students) obtained satisfactory accuracy 
      (ICC > .40, n = 10 videotapes) and also good to excellent interrater reliability 
      when compared to expert raters (ICC = .83 for adherence and .64 for competence, n = 
      26 videotapes). High rater stability was also found (n = 15 videotapes). The 
      findings suggest that the CAS-CBT is a reliable measure of adherence and competence 
      in manualized CBT for anxiety disorders in youth. Further research is needed to 
      investigate the validity of the scale and psychometric properties when used with 
      other treatment programs, disorders and treatment formats. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Baseline heartbeat perception accuracy and short-term outcome of brief 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia.
PG  - 426-35
LID - 10.1017/S135246581300101X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased heartbeat perception accuracy (HBP-accuracy) may contribute to 
      the pathogenesis of Panic Disorder (PD) without or with Agoraphobia (PDA). Extant 
      research suggests that HBP-accuracy is a rather stable individual characteristic, 
      moreover predictive of worse long-term outcome in PD/PDA patients. However, it 
      remains still unexplored whether HBP-accuracy adversely affects patients' short-term 
      outcome after structured cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PD/PDA. AIM: To 
      explore the potential association between HBP-accuracy and the short-term outcome of 
      a structured brief-CBT for the acute treatment of PDA. METHOD: We assessed baseline 
      HBP-accuracy using the "mental tracking" paradigm in 25 consecutive medication-free, 
      CBT-naive PDA patients. Patients then underwent a structured, protocol-based, 
      8-session CBT by the same therapist. Outcome measures included the number of panic 
      attacks during the past week, the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ), and 
      the Mobility Inventory-Alone subscale (MI-alone). RESULTS: No association emerged 
      between baseline HBP-accuracy and posttreatment changes concerning number of panic 
      attacks. Moreover, higher baseline HBP-accuracy was associated with significantly 
      larger reductions in the scores of the ACQ and the MI-alone scales. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results suggest that in PDA patients undergoing structured brief-CBT for the acute 
      treatment of their symptoms, higher baseline HBP-accuracy is not associated with 
      worse short-term outcome concerning panic attacks. Furthermore, higher baseline 
      HBP-accuracy may be associated with enhanced therapeutic gains in agoraphobic 
      cognitions and behaviours.

AB  - Lars-Göran Öst is one of the most eminent clinical researchers in the field of 
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and a founder of CBT in Sweden. He has recently 
      retired from his position as professor in clinical psychology at Stockholm 
      University, Sweden. In this paper, we sketch a brief description of the body of work 
      by Öst. Examples of his innovative and pioneering new treatment methods include the 
      one-session treatment for specific phobias, as well as applied relaxation for a 
      range of anxiety disorders and health conditions. While Öst remains active in the 
      field, he has contributed significantly to the development and dissemination of CBT 
      in Sweden as well as in the world.

TI  - A review on experimental and clinical genetic associations studies on fear 
      conditioning, extinction and cognitive-behavioral treatment.
PG  - e41
LID - 10.1038/tp.2011.36 [doi]
AB  - Fear conditioning and extinction represent basic forms of associative learning with 
      considerable clinical relevance and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      anxiety disorders. There is considerable inter-individual variation in the ability 
      to acquire and extinguish conditioned fear reactions and the study of genetic 
      variants has recently become a focus of research. In this review, we give an 
      overview of the existing genetic association studies on human fear conditioning and 
      extinction in healthy individuals and of related studies on cognitive-behavioral 
      treatment (CBT) and exposure, as well as pathology development after trauma. 
      Variation in the serotonin transporter (5HTT) and the catechol-o-methyltransferase 
      (COMT) genes has consistently been associated with effects in pre-clinical and 
      clinical studies. Interesting new findings, which however require further 
      replication, have been reported for genetic variation in the dopamine transporter 
      (DAT1) and the pituitary adenylate cyclase 1 receptor (ADCYAP1R1) genes, whereas the 
      current picture is inconsistent for variation in the brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor (BDNF) gene. We end with a discussion of the findings and their limitations, 
      as well as future directions that we hope will aid the field to develop further.

TI  - Severe Illness Anxiety Treated by Integrating Inpatient Psychotherapy With Medical 
      Care and Minimizing Reassurance.
PG  - 150

LID - 150
AB  - Illness anxiety disorder (IAD, formerly hypochondriasis) is characterized by 
      preoccupation with fear of serious illness despite medical reassurance. IAD is 
      common, debilitating, challenging to treat, and results in high healthcare 
      utilization. Outpatient management of IAD is challenging because patients can 
      compulsively seek reassurance from numerous providers, which interferes with 
      learning more productive coping skills. We present the case of a woman with severe 
      IAD who presented to the emergency room with increasing frequency over several 
      months, despite regular outpatient medical visits and escalating psychiatric care. 
      We made the unusual decision to hospitalize her for IAD for 1 month, in the absence 
      of typical hospitalization criteria. This hospitalization allowed us to consolidate 
      all medical and psychiatric care into a single provider team and train all staff and 
      family to communicate with her in a consistent manner. We successfully treated her 
      by integrating a general cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol into medical 
      care and decision-making. In response to her numerous health concerns, we minimized 
      medical work-up, reassurance, and reactive medication changes, and instead used the 
      concerns as opportunities to reinforce the psychotherapy. This approach allowed us 
      to simplify her medication regimen and manage her co-morbid hypertension and vitamin 
      deficiencies. Though inpatient hospitalization is likely infeasible in most cases of 
      IAD, outpatient providers may create similar treatment plans based on the example of 
      our case report, without needing highly specialized expertise. Such a plan would 
      require a straightforward understanding of IAD psychology, which we review here, 
      combined with readily accessible tools including a universal CBT protocol, online 
      CBT courses, and clinical symptom scales. We discuss our approach for responding to 
      health concerns, maintaining therapeutic alliance, integrating CBT principles into 
      patient interactions, and managing medications. Since patients with IAD share health 
      concerns with all providers, staff, and family, we also include our own IAD 
      communication guide, appropriate for a general audience, that demonstrates how to 
      respond in these conversations.

TI  - A cognitive behavioral therapy intervention to reduce fear of hypoglycemia in young 
      adults with type 1 diabetes (FREE): study protocol for a randomized controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 796
LID - 10.1186/s13063-019-3876-4 [doi]
LID - 796
AB  - BACKGROUND: In persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D), hypoglycemia is the major 
      limiting factor in achieving optimal glycemic control. All persons with T1D are at 
      risk for hypoglycemia (blood glucose level < 70 mg/dl), which is life-threatening 
      and accompanied by serious physical and psychological symptoms, resulting in 
      profound fear of hypoglycemia (FOH) and reduced quality of life. Young adults with 
      T1D are at risk for FOH and have worse glycemic control and self-management behavior 
      than other age groups with T1D. FOH also results in increased glycemic variability 
      (GV). A major gap exists in how to manage FOH. Our overall objective is to reduce 
      FOH and improve diabetes self-management, glycemic control, and GV in young adults 
      with T1D to reduce or delay diabetes complications and improve quality of life. We 
      aim to (1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of an eight-week cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT)-based Fear Reduction Efficacy Evaluation (FREE) 
      intervention in young adults with T1D who experience FOH; and (2) determine the 
      impact of the FREE intervention, compared to an attention control group, on the 
      outcomes FOH, self-management, glycemic control (A1C), and glycemic variability 
      (continuous glucose monitoring recordings). METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled 
      trial in 50 young adults aged 18 to 35 years with T1D will be used. Eligible 
      subjects will be randomized to the intervention program (Fear Reduction Efficacy 
      Evaluation [FREE]) or attention control group. A one-week run-in phase is planned, 
      with baseline measures of FOH, self-management behavior, A1C, and real-time 
      continuous glucose monitoring recordings (RT-CGM) to calculate GV for both groups. 
      The intervention group will participate in eight weekly individual one-hour sessions 
      using CBT and exposure treatment for specific fears. RT-CGM and a daily FOH diary 
      will be used as feedback cues as part of the FREE program. The attention control 
      group will participate in eight weekly individual one-hour diabetes self-management 
      education (DSME) sessions and wear a RT-CGM device (to measure GV only) over 8 
      weeks. At completion, FOH will be measured, and RT-CGM recordings will be analyzed 
      to determine differences between the FREE and control groups. DISCUSSION: Findings 
      from this proposed pilot study will serve as the foundation for a larger trial to 
      reduce FOH and improve self-management, glycemic control, and GV. TRIAL

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) anxiety intervention on social phobia, social skill 
      development, and self-concept. METHOD: Fifteen children with epilepsy and a primary 
      anxiety disorder participated in a CBT intervention for 12 weeks plus a 3-month 
      follow-up visit. Children were assessed at baseline, week 7, week 12, and 3 months 
      post treatment to measure changes in social phobia using the Screen for Child 
      Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED). Self-concept was also assessed by 
      using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale II (Piers-Harris 2). RESULTS: 
      There was a significant reduction in symptoms of social phobia and improved 
      self-concept at the end of the 12-week intervention and at the 3 month follow-up. 
      Repeated measures ANOVA's of child ratings revealed significant change over time on 
      the SCARED-Social Phobia/Social Anxiety subscale score (p=0.024). In terms of 
      self-concept, significant change over time was detected on the Piers-Harris 2-Total 
      score (p=0.015) and several subscale scores of Piers-Harris 2, including: Physical 
      Appearance and Attributes (p=0.016), Freedom from Anxiety (p=0.005), and Popularity 
      (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: This pilot investigation utilized an evidenced based CBT 
      intervention to reduce symptoms of social phobia, which in turn provided a vehicle 
      to address specific social skills improving self-concept in children with epilepsy.

TI  - Evaluation and management of insomnia in women with breast cancer.
PG  - 269-277
LID - 10.1007/s10549-020-05635-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Insomnia is a common issue among patients with breast cancer with a 
      potentially devastating impact on quality of life. It can be caused or exacerbated 
      by multiple disease and treatment-related factors. Despite the prevalence and impact 
      of insomnia, it is rarely addressed systematically in the oncology clinic. We 
      conducted a comprehensive review of insomnia to guide clinical care of patient's 
      with breast cancer and insomnia. METHODS: This manuscript reviews the prevalence, 
      etiology, emerging science and both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic options for 
      treatment of insomnia among patients with breast cancer. RESULTS: Multiple factors 
      contribute to insomnia among patients with breast cancer including endocrine therapy 
      and hotflashes, pain and discomfort from local therapy, and fear of recurrence. If 
      we do identify insomnia, there are treatment options and strategies available to 
      help patients. In particular, there is now a considerable body of evidence 
      supporting the use of psychosocial interventions and behavioral treatments, such as 
      cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), yoga, and mind-body programs. It 
      is also important for oncology providers to be educated regarding available 
      pharmacologic therapies and emerging data for cannabis-based therapy. CONCLUSION:

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia in older people: a 
      comparison with younger patients.
PG  - 669-77
LID - 10.1002/da.22274 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults with panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) are 
      underdiagnosed and undertreated, while studies of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      are lacking. This study compares the effectiveness of CBT for PDA in younger and 
      older adults. METHODS: A total of 172 patients with PDA (DSM-IV) received manualized 
      CBT. Primary outcome measures were avoidance behavior (Mobility Inventory Avoidance 
      scale) and agoraphobic cognitions (Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire), with 
      values of the younger (18-60 years) and older (≥ 60 years) patients being compared 
      using mixed linear models adjusted for baseline inequalities, and predictive effects 
      of chronological age, age at PDA onset and duration of illness (DOI) being examined 
      using multiple linear regressions. RESULTS: Attrition rates were 2/31 (6%) for the 
      over-60s and 31/141 (22%) for the under-60s group (χ(2) = 3.43, df = 1, P = .06). 
      Patients in both age groups improved on all outcome measures with moderate-to-large 
      effect sizes. Avoidance behavior had improved significantly more in the 60+ group (F 
      = 4.52, df = 1,134, P = .035), with agoraphobic cognitions showing no age-related 
      differences. Baseline severity of agoraphobic avoidance and agoraphobic cognitions 
      were the most salient predictors of outcome (range standardized betas 0.59 through 
      0.76, all P-values < .001). Apart from a superior reduction of agoraphobic avoidance 
      in the 60+ participants (β = -0.30, P = .037), chronological age was not related to 
      outcome, while in the older patients higher chronological age, late-onset type and 
      short DOI were linked to superior improvement of agoraphobic avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: 
      CBT appears feasible for 60+ PDA-patients, yielding outcomes that are similar and 
      sometimes even superior to those obtained in younger patients.

LID - 10.2147/NDT.S58660 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Inconsistent results continue to be reported in studies that examine the neural 
      correlates of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with panic disorder. We 
      examined the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) associated with the 
      alleviation of anxiety by CBT in panic patients. METHODS: The change in rCBF and 
      clinical symptoms before and after CBT were assessed using single photon emission 
      computed tomography and various clinical measures were analyzed. RESULTS: Fourteen 
      subjects who completed CBT showed significant improvements in symptoms on clinical 
      measures, including the Panic and Agoraphobic Scale and the Anxiety Sensitivity 
      Index-Revised. After CBT, increased rCBF was detected in the left postcentral gyrus 
      (BA 43), left precentral gyrus (BA 4), and left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 9 and BA 
      47), whereas decreased rCBF was detected in the left pons. Correlation analysis of 
      the association between the changes in rCBF and changes in each clinical measure did 
      not show significant results. CONCLUSION: We found changes in the rCBF associated 
      with the successful completion of CBT. The present findings may help clarify the 
      effects of CBT on changes in brain activity in panic disorder.

TI  - Cerebellar Neural Circuits Involving Executive Control Network Predict Response to 
      Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Social Anxiety Disorder.
PG  - 673-682
LID - 10.1007/s12311-017-0845-x [doi]
AB  - Some intrinsic connectivity networks including the default mode network (DMN) and 
      executive control network (ECN) may underlie social anxiety disorder (SAD). Although 
      the cerebellum has been implicated in the pathophysiology of SAD and several 
      networks relevant to higher-order cognition, it remains unknown whether cerebellar 
      areas involved in DMN and ECN exhibit altered resting-state functional connectivity 
      (rsFC) with cortical networks in SAD. Forty-six patients with SAD and 64 healthy 
      controls (HC) were included and submitted to the baseline resting-state functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seventeen SAD patients who completed 
      post-treatment clinical assessments were included after group cognitive behavior 
      therapy (CBT). RsFC of three cerebellar subregions in both groups was assessed 
      respectively in a voxel-wise way, and these rsFC maps were compared by two-sample t 
      tests between groups. Whole-brain voxel-wise regression was performed to examine 
      whether cerebellar connectivity networks can predict response to CBT. Lower rsFC 
      circuits of cerebellar subregions compared with HC at baseline (p < 0.05, corrected 
      by false discovery rate) were revealed. The left Crus I rsFC with dorsal medial 
      prefrontal cortex was negatively correlated with symptom severity. The clinical 
      assessments in SAD patients were significantly decreased after CBT. Higher 
      pretreatment cerebellar rsFC with angular gyrus and dorsal lateral frontal cortex 
      corresponded with greater symptom improvement following CBT. Cerebellar rsFC 
      circuits involving DMN and ECN are possible neuropathologic mechanisms of SAD. 
      Stronger pretreatment cerebellar rsFC circuits involving ECN suggest potential 
      neural markers to predict CBT response.

TI  - Directed threat imagery in generalized anxiety disorder.
PG  - 617-628
LID - 10.1017/S0033291717001957 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worrying has been suggested to prevent emotional and elaborative 
      processing of fears. In cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), generalized anxiety 
      disorder (GAD) patients are exposed to their fears during the method of directed 
      threat imagery by inducing emotional reactivity. However, studies investigating 
      neural correlates of directed threat imagery and emotional reactivity in GAD 
      patients are lacking. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study 
      aimed at delineating neural correlates of directed threat imagery in GAD patients. 
      METHOD: Nineteen GAD patients and 19 healthy controls (HC) were exposed to narrative 
      scripts of either disorder-related or neutral content and were encouraged to imagine 
      it as vividly as possible. RESULTS: Rating results showed that GAD patients 
      experienced disorder-related scripts as more anxiety inducing and arousing than HC. 
      These results were also reflected in fMRI data: Disorder-related v. neutral scripts 
      elicited elevated activity in the amygdala, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, 
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the thalamus as well as reduced activity in the 
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in GAD patients 
      relative to HC. CONCLUSION: The present study presents the first behavioral and 
      neural evidence for emotional reactivity during directed threat imagery in GAD. The 
      brain activity pattern suggests an involvement of a fear processing network as a 
      neural correlate of initial exposure during directed imagery in CBT in GAD.

TI  - Does a preoperative cognitive-behavioral intervention affect disability, pain 
      behavior, pain, and return to work the first year after lumbar spinal fusion 
      surgery?
PG  - 593-600
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000000843 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial including 90 patients. OBJECTIVE: To 
      examine the effect of a preoperative cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBT) for 
      patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion (LSF) surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: 
      Few published studies have looked at the potential of rehabilitation to improve 
      outcomes after LSF. Rehabilitation programs using CBT are recommended. Furthermore, 
      initiating interventions preoperatively seems beneficial, but only limited data 
      exist in the field of spine surgery. METHODS: Patients with degenerative disc 
      disease or spondylolisthesis undergoing LSF were randomized to usual care (control 
      group) or preoperative CBT and usual care (CBT group). Primary outcome was change in 
      Oswestry Disability Index from baseline to 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were 
      catastrophizing, fear avoidance belief, work status, and back and leg pain. RESULTS: 
      At 1-year follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference between the 
      CBT group and the control group in Oswestry Disability Index score (P = 0.082). 
      However, the CBT group had achieved a significant reduction of -15 points (-26; -4) 
      already at 3 months (between group difference P = 0.003), and this reduction was 
      maintained throughout the year. There were no differences between groups at 1-year 
      follow-up with regard to any of the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Participating in 
      a preoperative CBT intervention in addition to usual care did not produce better 
      outcomes at 1-year follow-up for patients undergoing LSF. Although the reduction in 
      disability was achieved much faster in the CBT group, resulting in a significant 
      difference between groups already 3 months after surgery, it did not translate into 
      a faster return to work. Our findings support the need for further research into the

      anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala during emotion regulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 
      other internalizing conditions attempts to improve emotion regulation. Accumulating 
      data indicate anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and to a lesser extent amygdala, 
      activation in various tasks predicts treatment outcome. However, little is known 
      about ACC and amygdala activation to emotion regulation in predicting clinical 
      improvement following CBT in SAD. METHODS: Before treatment, 38 SAD patients 
      completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation paradigms during fMRI. Implicit 
      regulation involved attentional control over negative distractors. Explicit 
      regulation comprised cognitive reappraisal to negative images. Pre-CBT brain 
      activity was circumscribed to anatomical-based ACC sub-regions (rostral, dorsal) and 
      amygdala masks, which were submitted to ROC curves to examine predictive validity as 
      well as correlational analysis to evaluate prognostic change in symptom severity. 
      RESULTS: More rostral (rACC) activity in implicit regulation and less rACC activity 
      during explicit regulation distinguished responders (34%) from non-responders. 
      Greater amygdala response in implicit regulation also foretold responder status. 
      Baseline rACC and amygdala activity during attentional control correlated with 
      pre-to-post CBT change in symptom severity such that more activation was related to 
      greater decline in symptoms. No significant correlations were observed for explicit 
      regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Across forms of regulation, rACC activity predicted 
      responder status whereas amygdala as a neuromarker was limited to implicit 
      regulation. While the direction of effects (enhanced vs. reduced) in rACC activity 
      was task-dependent, results suggest SAD patients with deficient regulation benefited 
      more from CBT. Findings support previous studies involving patients with depression 
      and suggest the rACC may be a viable marker of clinical improvement in SAD.

TI  - Predicting Response Trajectories during Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Panic 
      Disorder: No Association with the BDNF Gene or Childhood Maltreatment.
PG  - e0158224
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158224 [doi]
LID - e0158224
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and result in low quality of life 
      and a high social and economic cost. The efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy 
      (CBT) for anxiety disorders is well established, but a substantial proportion of 
      patients do not respond to this treatment. Understanding which genetic and 
      environmental factors are responsible for this differential response to treatment is 
      a key step towards "personalized medicine". Based on previous research, our 
      objective was to test whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and/or childhood 
      maltreatment are associated with response trajectories during exposure-based CBT for 
      panic disorder (PD). METHOD: We used Growth Mixture Modeling to identify latent 
      classes of change (response trajectories) in patients with PD (N = 97) who underwent 
      group manualized exposure-based CBT. We conducted logistic regression to investigate 
      the effect on these trajectories of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and two different 
      types of childhood maltreatment, abuse and neglect. RESULTS: We identified two 
      response trajectories ("high response" and "low response"), and found that they were 
      not significantly associated with either the genetic (BDNF Val66Met polymorphism) or 
      childhood trauma-related variables of interest, nor with an interaction between 
      these variables. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support an effect of the BDNF 
      gene or childhood trauma-related variables on CBT outcome in PD. Future studies in 
      this field may benefit from looking at other genotypes or using different (e.g. 
      whole-genome) approaches.

TI  - Evaluation of an open-access CBT-based Internet program for social anxiety: Patterns 
      of use, retention, and outcomes.
PG  - 988-999
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000232 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been 
      established as both efficacious and effective in reducing symptoms of social 
      anxiety. However, most research has been conducted in controlled settings, and 
      little is known regarding the utility of such programs in an open-access format. The 
      present study examined the use, adherence, and effectiveness of Joyable, an 
      open-access, Internet-delivered, coach-supported CBT-based intervention for social 
      anxiety. METHOD: Participants were 3,384 registered users (Mage [SD] = 29.82 [7.89]; 
      54% male) that created an account between 2014 and 2016. Characteristics of use, 
      factors related to attrition and adherence, and within-group outcomes were examined. 
      The primary outcome measure was the Social Phobia Inventory. RESULTS: On average, 
      participants remained in the program for 81.02 days (SD = 60.50), during which they 
      completed 12.14 activities (SD = 11.09) and 1.53 exposures (SD = 3.18). About half 
      (57%) had contact with a coach. Full adherence to the program was achieved by 16% of 
      participants, a rate higher than previously published open-access studies of ICBT. 
      Social anxiety symptoms were significantly reduced for participants that engaged in 
      the program, with medium within-group effects from baseline through the cognitive 
      restructuring module (d = 0.63-0.76) and large effects from baseline through the 
      exposure module (d = 1.40-1.83). Response rates were high (72%). Exposures and coach 
      contact were significant predictors of retention and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      open-access online CBT-based program is effective in reducing social anxiety 
      symptoms and has the potential to extend Internet-based mental health services to 
      socially anxious individuals unwilling or unable to seek face-to-face evidence-based 
      therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
PG  - 99-110
LID - 10.1007/s11920-010-0173-z [doi]
AB  - This article reviews the current screening and assessment tools for anxiety 
      disorders in children and adolescents, as well as evidence-based treatment 
      interventions for these disorders. The following anxiety disorders are discussed: 
      separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic 
      disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and selective mutism. There are 
      several well-studied screening and assessment tools to identify childhood anxiety 
      disorders early and differentiate the various anxiety disorders. Evaluations of 
      baseline somatic symptoms, severity, and impairment ratings of the anxiety 
      disorders, and collecting ratings from several sources is clinically helpful in 
      assessment and treatment follow-up. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been 
      extensively studied and has shown good efficacy in treatment of childhood anxiety 
      disorders. A combination of CBT and medication may be required for moderate to 
      severely impairing anxiety disorders and may improve functioning better than either 
      intervention alone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are currently the only 
      medications that have consistently shown efficacy in treatment of anxiety disorders 
      in children and adolescents. Despite proven efficacy, the availability of CBT in the 
      community is limited. Current research is focusing on early identification of 
      anxiety disorders in community settings, increasing the availability of 
      evidence-based interventions, and modification of interventions for specific 
      populations.

TI  - Transdiagnostic group CBT vs. standard group CBT for depression, social anxiety 
      disorder and agoraphobia/panic disorder: Study protocol for a pragmatic, multicenter 
      non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 37

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TCBT) manuals delivered in 
      individual format have been reported to be just as effective as traditional 
      diagnosis specific CBT manuals. We have translated and modified the "The Unified 
      Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders" (UP-CBT) for group 
      delivery in Mental Health Service (MHS), and shown effects comparable to traditional 
      CBT in a naturalistic study. As the use of one manual instead of several 
      diagnosis-specific manuals could simplify logistics, reduce waiting time, and 
      increase therapist expertise compared to diagnosis specific CBT, we aim to test the 
      relative efficacy of group UP-CBT and diagnosis specific group CBT. METHODS/DESIGN: 
      The study is a partially blinded, pragmatic, non-inferiority, parallel, multi-center 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of UP-CBT vs diagnosis specific CBT for Unipolar 
      Depression, Social Anxiety Disorder and Agoraphobia/Panic Disorder. In total, 248 
      patients are recruited from three regional MHS centers across Denmark and included 
      in two intervention arms. The primary outcome is patient-ratings of well-being (WHO 
      Well-being Index, WHO-5), secondary outcomes include level of depressive and anxious 
      symptoms, personality variables, emotion regulation, reflective functioning, and 
      social adjustment. Assessments are conducted before and after therapy and at 
      6 months follow-up. Weekly patient-rated outcomes and group evaluations are 
      collected for every session. Outcome assessors, blind to treatment allocation, will 
      perform the observer-based symptom ratings, and fidelity assessors will monitor 
      manual adherence. DISCUSSION: The current study will be the first RCT investigating 
      the dissemination of the UP in a MHS setting, the UP delivered in groups, and with 
      depressive patients included. Hence the results are expected to add substantially to 
      the evidence base for rational group psychotherapy in MHS. The planned moderator and 
      mediator analyses could spur new hypotheses about mechanisms of change in 
      psychotherapy and the association between patient characteristics and treatment 
      effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02954731 . Registered 25 October

AB  - Recent reviews and treatment guidelines regard trauma-focused cognitive-behavior 
      therapies as the treatments of choice for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD). However, many patients do not engage in this treatment when it is available, 
      drop out before completion, or do not respond. Medications remain widely used, alone 
      and in conjunction with psychotherapy, although the limitations of traditional 
      monoamine-based pharmacotherapy are increasingly recognized. This article will 
      review recent developments in psychopharmacology for PTSD, with a focus on current 
      clinical data that apply putative neurobiologic mechanisms to medication use-i.e., a 
      theranostic approach. A theranostic approach however, also requires consideration of 
      timing, pre, peri or post trauma in conjunction with underlying dynamic processes 
      affecting synaptic plasticity, the HPA axis, hippocampal activation, PFC-amygdala 
      circuitry and fear memory.

AB  - Although cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective first-line intervention 
      for anxiety disorders, treatments remain long and cost-intensive, difficult to 
      access, and a subgroup of patients fails to show any benefits at all. This study 
      aimed to identify functional and structural brain markers that predict a rapid 
      response to CBT. Such knowledge will be important to establish the mechanisms 
      underlying successful treatment and to develop more effective, shorter 
      interventions. Fourteen unmedicated patients with panic disorder underwent 3 T 
      functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before receiving four 
      sessions of exposure-based CBT. Symptom severity was measured before and after 
      treatment. During functional MRI, patients performed an emotion regulation task, 
      either viewing negative images naturally, or intentionally down-regulating negative 
      affect by using previously taught strategies of cognitive reappraisal. Structural 
      MRI images were analysed including left and right segmentation and volume 
      estimation. Improved response to brief CBT was predicted by increased pre-treatment 
      activation in bilateral insula and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) 
      during threat processing, as well as increased right hippocampal gray matter volume. 
      Previous work links these regions to improved threat processing and fear memory 
      activation, suggesting that the activation of such mechanisms is crucial for 
      exposure-based CBT to be effective.

      strategies.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - In this article, we review the efficacy and applications of cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) for panic disorder. Research supports CBT as an effective first-line 
      treatment of panic disorder that offers relatively quick onset of action and 
      long-term maintenance of treatment benefits. These characteristics, plus the 
      acceptability, tolerability, and cost-efficacy of CBT, make it an especially 
      attractive treatment option for panic disorder. We review these findings as well as 
      some newer developments in the field including research on emotional acceptance, the 
      importance of context in extinction learning, and the use of CBT in combination with 
      pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Confusion between panic and asthma symptoms can result in serious self-management 
      errors. A cognitive behavior psychophysiological therapy (CBPT) intervention was 
      culturally adapted for Latinos consisting of CBT for panic disorder (PD), asthma 
      education, differentiation between panic and asthma symptoms, and heart rate 
      variability biofeedback. An RCT compared CBPT to music and relaxation therapy (MRT), 
      which included listening to relaxing music and paced breathing at resting 
      respiration rates. Fifty-three Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) adults with asthma 
      and PD were randomly assigned to CBPT or MRT for 8 weekly sessions. Both groups 
      showed improvements in PD severity, asthma control, and several other anxiety and 
      asthma outcome measures from baseline to post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. CBPT 
      showed an advantage over MRT for improvement in adherence to inhaled 
      corticosteroids. Improvements in PD severity were mediated by anxiety sensitivity in 
      CBPT and by depression in MRT, although earlier levels of these mediators did not 
      predict subsequent improvements. Attrition was high (40%) in both groups, albeit 
      comparable to CBT studies targeting anxiety in Latinos. Additional strategies are 
      needed to improve retention in this high-risk population. Both CBPT and MRT may be 
      efficacious interventions for comorbid asthma-PD, and CBPT may offer additional 
      benefits for improving medication adherence.

TI  - Transfer of manualized CBT for social phobia into clinical practice (SOPHO-PRAX): a 
      study protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-13-70 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is generally known to be efficacious 
      in the treatment of social phobia when applied in RCTs, namely when the treatment 
      manual is based on the Clark-Wells approach. However, little is known about the 
      efficacy of manualized treatments in routine clinical practice (Phase IV of 
      psychotherapy research). The present study (SOPHO-PRAX) is a continuation of a large 
      multicenter randomized clinical trial (SOPHO-NET) and analyzes the extent to which 
      additional training practitioners in manualized procedures enhances treatment 
      effect. METHODS/DESIGN: Thirty-six private practitioners will be included in three 
      treatment centers and randomly designated to either training in manualized CBT or no 
      specific training. The treatment effects of the therapies conducted by both groups 
      of therapists will be compared. A total of 162 patients (n=116 completers; n=58 per 
      condition) will be enrolled. Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) will serve as 
      primary outcome measure. Remission from social phobia is defined as LSAS total ≤ 30 
      points. Data will be collected at treatment begin, after 8, 15, and 25 sessions (50 
      min each), at treatment completion, as well at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. 
      DISCUSSION: The present CBT trial combines elements of randomized controlled trials 
      and naturalistic studies in an innovative way. It will directly inform about the 
      incremental effects of procedures established in a controlled trial into clinical 
      practice. Study results are relevant to healthcare decisions and policy. They may 
      serve to improve quality of treatment, and shorten the time frame between the 
      development and widespread dissemination of effective methods, thereby reducing 
      health cost expenditure.The results of this study will not only inform about the 
      degree to which the new methods lead to an improvement of treatment course and 
      outcome, but also about whether the effects of routine psychotherapeutic treatment

AB  - Although there is substantial evidence to support the efficacy of 
      cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
      there is some debate about how these treatments have their effects. Modern learning 
      theory and cognitive and emotional processing theories highlight the importance of 
      reducing avoidance, facilitating the constructive processing of feared experiences, 
      and strengthening new inhibitory learning. We examined variables thought to be 
      associated with unproductive and constructive processing of traumatic experiences in 
      a sample of 81 youth with elevated PTSD symptoms, who received Trauma-Focused 
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) for abuse or traumatic interpersonal loss. 
      Sessions during the trauma narrative phase of TF-CBT were coded for indicators of 
      unproductive processing (overgeneralization, rumination, avoidance) and constructive 
      processing (decentering, accommodation of corrective information), as well as levels 
      of negative emotion. In previous analyses of this trial (Ready et al., 2015), more 
      overgeneralization during the narrative phase predicted less improvement in 
      internalizing symptoms at posttreatment and a worsening of externalizing symptoms 
      over the 12-month follow-up. In contrast, more accommodation predicted improvement 
      in internalizing symptoms and also moderated the negative effects of 
      overgeneralization on internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The current study 
      examined correlates of overgeneralization and accommodation. Overgeneralization was 
      associated with more rumination, less decentering, and more negative emotion, 
      suggesting immersion in trauma-related material. Accommodation was associated with 
      less avoidance and more decentering, suggesting a healthy distance from 
      trauma-related material that might allow for processing and cognitive change. 
      Decentering also predicted improvement in externalizing symptoms at posttreatment. 
      Rumination and avoidance showed important associations with overgeneralization and 
      accommodation, respectively, but did not predict treatment outcomes. This study 
      identifies correlates of overgeneralization and accommodation that might shed light 
      on how these variables relate to unproductive and constructive processing of 
      traumatic experiences.

TI  - Virtual reality exposure in the treatment of fear of flying.
PG  - 899-903
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, a growing body of research has appeared on different aspects 
      of virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy applied to the treatment of anxiety 
      disorders. The purpose of this article was to review with a systematic methodology 
      the evidences that support the potential effectiveness of this therapy in the 
      treatment of fear of flying (FOF), a problem that significantly affects patients' 
      social functioning and personal welfare. METHODS: Potential studies were identified 
      via computerized search using the PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases, and 
      additional review of their references. Articles ranged from 1969 to 2007 and the 
      keywords used in the search were: "virtual reality" and "fear of flying"; "virtual 
      reality" and "flying phobia"; or "virtual reality" and "flight phobia." RESULTS: 
      There were 40 studies using VRE in the treatment of FOF identified, mostly on the 
      effectiveness of VRE therapy in group and case studies. Several components of the 
      treatment protocols differed among the studies, which made the results comparison a 
      challenging task. Nevertheless, controlled studies demonstrate that VRE treatment is 
      effective with or without cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and/or psychoeducation 
      and that it is considered to be an effective component of the treatment of FOF. 
      CONCLUSIONS: All studies that used cognitive and relaxation techniques in addition 
      to VRE treatment were effective. More randomized clinical trials are required in 
      which VRE therapy could be compared with standard exposure therapy. Thus, we suggest 
      that CBT, psychoeducation, and VRE could be combined to treat FOF.

TI  - Accelerated Outpatient Individual Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Social Anxiety 
      Disorder: A Preliminary Pilot Study.
PG  - 690-705
LID - 10.1017/S1352465818000267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and chronic mental health 
      condition. Given the significant prevalence and impairment caused by SAD, it is 
      important to investigate novel ways to improve the efficacy of cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT) for SAD. One approach may be to provide CBT in an accelerated fashion, 
      which involves multiple sessions per week. Such accelerated treatments have been 
      shown to be effective in other anxiety disorders, but in SAD this accelerated 
      treatment has only been studied in a group treatment format. AIMS: The aim of this 
      study was to provide a preliminary investigation of the efficacy of individual 
      accelerated CBT (aCBT) in the treatment of SAD. METHOD: The studied utilized an open 
      trial design. Seventeen participants commenced the treatment, which consisted of 12 
      sessions delivered over 4 weeks. RESULTS: The results indicated that participants 
      obtained moderate to large effect sizes on measures of SAD at post-treatment (range 
      d = 0.76-0.92) and 3-month follow-up (range d = 1.31-1.79). In addition, at 
      post-treatment, 59% of participants no longer met criteria for SAD, and this number 
      increased to 71% at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide preliminary 
      evidence to suggest that individual aCBT may be an important treatment option for 
      individuals with SAD.

TI  - Importance of knowledge in the behavioural treatment of panic disorder.
PG  - 611-615
LID - 10.1017/S135246581900002X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for panic disorder encourages 
      patients to learn about and make changes to thoughts and behaviour patterns that 
      maintain symptoms of the disorder. Instruments to assess whether or not patients 
      understand therapy content do not currently exist. AIMS: The aim of this study was 
      to examine if increases within specific knowledge domains of panic disorder were 
      related to improvement in panic symptoms following an intensive 2-day panic 
      treatment. METHOD: Thirty-nine Veterans enrolled in an intensive weekend panic 
      disorder treatment completed knowledge measures immediately before the first session 
      of therapy and at the end of the last day of therapy. Four panic disorder experts 
      evaluated items and reached consensus on subscales. Subscales were reduced further 
      to create psychometrically sound subscales of catastrophic misinterpretation (CM), 
      behaviours (BE), and self-efficacy (SE). A simple regression analysis was conducted 
      to determine whether increased knowledge predicted symptom change at a 3-month 
      follow-up assessment. RESULTS: The overall knowledge scale was reduced to three 
      subscales BE (n = 7), CM (n = 13) and SE (n = 8) with good internal consistency. 
      Veterans' knowledge of panic disorder improved from pre- to post-treatment. Greater 
      increase in scores on the knowledge assessment predicted lower panic severity scores 
      at a 3-month follow-up. A follow-up analysis using the three subscales as predictors 
      showed that only changes in CM significantly contributed to the prediction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In an intensive therapy format, reduction in panic severity was related 
      to improved knowledge overall, but particularly as a result of fewer catastrophic 
      misinterpretations.

AB  - Cognitive Behaviour Therapy has been demonstrated to be an effective intervention in 
      outpatient and inpatient settings for a wide range of presenting mental health 
      problems including depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Post traumatic Stress 
      Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder and Somatorform Disorder. There is 
      likely to be an unmet need for this therapeutic approach in most Low and Middle 
      Income Countries (LMIC). However, the training of therapists to deliver this 
      intervention has historically been a lengthy and expensive process, with already 
      highly trained staff such as psychiatrists and psychologists undertaking additional 
      training of up to one year duration in order to develop expertise in this area. This 
      paper proposes that a model where training, supervision, leadership and service 
      evaluation is provided by a small number of highly trained staff to front-line 
      non-specialist staff who will then deliver manualised therapy. These front-line 
      staff may also be conceptualised as part of a stepped care model where self-help and 
      manualised therapy approaches are used in the first instance. Where patient 
      functioning does not improve there is then the possibility of being stepped-up for 
      treatment by a more specialised and highly trained therapist. This approach may help 
      in meeting the huge mental health treatment gap in LMIC. This paper also suggests 
      that lessons learnt from the dissemination of behaviourally informed parenting 
      interventions internationally can be applied to the dissemination of this 
      therapeutic approach.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are an enormous societal burden given their high lifetime 
      prevalence among adult populations worldwide. A variety of anxiety disorders can be 
      successfully treated with psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and acceptance and 
      commitment therapy (ACT), either as stand-alone individual or group treatment or as 
      adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence 
      suggests that therapist-guided Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) and, to some degree, 
      digitalized mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions may be an efficacious 
      complement to traditional face-to-face therapy. In view of the current advances 
      regarding the integration of traditional and innovative treatment approaches, this 
      chapter provides an overview on the theory and evidence base for different delivery 
      modes of CBT-related interventions for specific phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, 
      social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder in adults. Finally, 
      implications for clinical practice and research will be derived, and future 
      directions for the psychological treatment of anxiety disorders will be outlined.

TI  - Interpersonal Factors Are Associated with Lower Therapist Adherence in 
      Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Panic Disorder.
PG  - 272-84
LID - 10.1002/cpp.1955 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The contributions of disorder severity, comorbidity and interpersonal 
      variables to therapists' adherence to a cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) manual 
      were tested. METHOD: Thirty-eight patients received panic control therapy (PCT) for 
      panic disorder. Trained observers watching videotapes of the sixth session of a 
      24-session protocol rated therapists' adherence to PCT and their use of 
      interventions from outside the CBT model. Different observers rated patients' 
      behavioural resistance to therapy in the same session using the client resistance 
      code. Interview measures obtained before treatment included the Panic Disorder 
      Severity Scale, the anxiety disorders interview schedule for Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV and the structured clinical 
      interview for DSM-IV, Axis II. Questionnaire measures were the anxiety sensitivity 
      index at intake, and, at session 2, the therapist and client versions of the working 
      alliance inventory-short form. RESULTS: The higher the patients' resistance and the 
      more Axis II traits a patient had, the less adherent the therapist. Moreover, the 
      more resistant the client, the more therapists resorted to interventions from 
      outside the CBT model. Stronger therapist and patient alliance was also generally 
      related to better adherence, but these results were somewhat inconsistent across 
      therapists. Pretreatment disorder severity and comorbidity were not related to 
      adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Interpersonal variables, particularly behavioural resistance 
      to therapy, are related to therapists' ability to adhere to a treatment manual and 
      to their use of interventions from outside of the CBT model. Copyright © 2015 John 
      Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Patients' behavioural resistance to 
      therapy may make it more difficult for cognitive-behavioural clinicians to adhere to 
      a structured treatment protocol and more likely for them to borrow interventions 
      from outside the CBT model. Patients' Axis II traits may make adherence to treatment 
      CBT protocol more difficult, although whether this is true varies across therapists. 
      Therapists' adherence to a structured protocol and borrowing from outside of the CBT 
      model do not appear to be affected by disorder severity or Axis I comorbidity.

TI  - The effect of Korean-group cognitive behavioural therapy among patients with panic 
      disorder in clinic settings.
PG  - 28-40
LID - 10.1111/jpm.12337 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Panic disorder patients display various panic-related 
      physical symptoms and catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations, which 
      lower their quality of life by interfering with daily activities. Cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) is a useful strategy for panic disorder patients to manage 
      symptoms associated with inaccurate cognitive interpretation of situations resulting 
      from the patient's cognitive vulnerability. In South Korea, however, despite the 
      increasing prevalence of panic disorder, CBT is not a common element of nursing care 
      plans for panic disorder patients. Moreover, few Korean researchers have attempted 
      to assess the effects of CBT on such patients. WHAT THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING 
      KNOWLEDGE?: In a strategy combining CBT and routine treatments, patients with panic 
      disorder can experience greater positive effects in the acute treatment phase than 
      those they experience when receiving only routine treatment. WHAT ARE THE 
      IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Mental health professionals, especially psychiatric 
      nurses in local clinics who operate most special mental health programmes for panic 
      disorder patients, should apply a panic disorder management programme that 
      integrates CBT and routine treatments. The integrated approach is more effective for 
      reducing the number of panic attacks and cognitive misinterpretation in patients 
      than providing routine treatment alone. For patients with panic disorder, the 
      objective of CBT is to understand the relationship between psychological panic 
      disorder sensations, emotions, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, nurses can help 
      patients address and improve biological, social and psychological aspects of 
      physical health problems as well as help them improve their coping skills in 
      general. ABSTRACT: Introduction In panic disorder, sensitivity to bodily sensations 
      increases due to the patient's cognitive vulnerability. Cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT) can help to decrease sensitivity to bodily sensations by correcting 
      these cognitive distortions by controlling negative thoughts and panic attacks. Aims 
      This study verified whether group CBT is more effective than treatment as usual 
      (TAU) in South Korean patients with panic disorder. Methods The study participants 
      consisted of 76 panic disorder patients. Patients in the therapy condition attended 
      sessions once a week for a total of 12 sessions in addition to drug treatment. 
      Results In the therapy condition, there were significant decreases in panic-related 
      bodily sensations and ranking and belief scores for catastrophic misinterpretation 
      of external events. Discussion Group CBT, in comparison to TAU, decreases panic and 
      agoraphobia symptom severity in South Korean patients with panic disorder. Our study 
      provides evidence for the effectiveness of a panic disorder management programme 
      that integrates group CBT and traditional pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients 
      with panic disorder. Implications for Practice The cognitive behavioural approach is 
      needed to reduce panic and agoraphobia symptoms for hospitalized patients with panic 
      disorder more than activity therapies, medications and supportive counselling by 
      doctors and nurses.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder: a review of treatment elements, 
      strategies, and outcomes.
PG  - 356-62
AB  - This article provides an overview of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic 
      disorder. CBT is currently considered a first-line treatment for panic disorder. It 
      offers benefit after short-term intervention, typically consisting of 12-15 sessions 
      conducted in either an individual or a group format. The treatment focuses on the 
      elimination of the patterns that underlie and perpetuate the disorder. Through CBT, 
      patients learn about the nature of the disorder and acquire a set of strategies that 
      counter the fears of panic attacks themselves, and break the recurring cycle of 
      anticipatory anxiety, panic, and agoraphobic avoidance. The collaborative format of 
      treatment, and a focus on elimination of core fears may be factors in enhancing 
      longer-term outcome. In this article, we review the efficacy of CBT as a first-line 
      treatment, a strategy for medication nonresponders, a replacement strategy for 
      patients who wish to discontinue pharmacotherapy, and a potential preventive 
      strategy for at-risk individuals. We also discuss some of the complex issues 
      involved with combination-treatment strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
      emotional disorders such as anxiety or depression, but the mechanisms underlying 
      successful intervention are far from understood. Although it has been a long-held 
      view that psychopharmacological approaches work by directly targeting automatic 
      emotional information processing in the brain, it is usually postulated that 
      psychological treatments affect these processes only over time, through changes in 
      more conscious thought cycles. This study explored the role of early changes in 
      emotional information processing in CBT action. METHODS: Twenty-eight untreated 
      patients with panic disorder were randomized to a single session of exposure-based 
      CBT or waiting group. Emotional information processing was measured on the day after 
      intervention with an attentional visual probe task, and clinical symptoms were 
      assessed on the day after intervention and at 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: Vigilance 
      for threat information was decreased in the treated group, compared with the waiting 
      group, the day after intervention, before reductions in clinical symptoms. The 
      magnitude of this early effect on threat vigilance predicted therapeutic response 
      after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioral therapy rapidly affects automatic 
      processing, and these early effects are predictive of later therapeutic change. Such 
      results suggest very fast action on automatic processes mediating threat 
      sensitivity, and they provide an early marker of treatment response. Furthermore, 
      these findings challenge the notion that psychological treatments work directly on 
      conscious thought processes before automatic information processing and imply a 
      greater similarity between early effects of pharmacological and psychological 
      treatments for anxiety than previously thought.

TI  - Children and parents' experiences of cognitive behavioral therapy for dental 
      anxiety--a qualitative study.
PG  - 317-26
LID - 10.1111/ipd.12181 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of dental anxiety in children and 
      adolescents. Cognitive behavioral therapy is emerging as a treatment option. AIM: 
      The purpose of this study is to explore how children with dental anxiety and their 
      parents experience cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in dentistry. DESIGN: We 
      interviewed 12 children and one of their parents and conducted a thematic analysis 
      of the transcribed interviews. RESULTS: Perspective shift emerged as overarching 
      theme in our thematic analysis. This theme consisted of three main themes, which 
      were mastery, safety, and reduced fear. Six subthemes were also identified according 
      to our analyses. Mastery includes two subthemes, gradual exposure and autonomy and 
      control. Subthemes and sources for safety feeling were therapeutic alliance and 
      changed appraisal. The theme reduced fear also consisted of two subthemes; reduced 
      anticipatory anxiety and coping. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that parents and 
      children had positive experiences of CBT and its outcome and were able to benefit 
      from this psychological treatment when dealing with dental anxiety.

TI  - Internet-guided self-help with or without exposure therapy for phobic and panic 
      disorders.
PG  - 154-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: As many sufferers from phobic and panic (phobia/panic) disorders cannot 
      get to suitable therapists, routine aspects of therapy were delegated to 
      internet-accessed computer-aided self-help with or without exposure instructions. 
      METHODS: Phobia/panic referrals were randomised to computer-aided self-help via the 
      internet at home in a 2:1 ratio either by self-exposure cognitive behaviour therapy 
      (CBT) [FearFighter (FF), n = 45] or by minimal CBT without exposure [Managing 
      Anxiety (MA), n = 23]. All had brief backup phone advice from a clinician concerning 
      their computer guidance. RESULTS: On self-ratings and blinded assessor ratings, 
      patients improved equally with each form of self-help over 10 treatment weeks but 
      significantly more on 5 out of 10 measures by week 14 (1-month follow-up) when the 
      self-help included self-exposure instructions than when it did not. In accord with 
      this, standardised effect sizes (Cohen's d) indicated superiority of FF over MA on 5 
      measures by week 14. Satisfaction with treatment in all patients pooled correlated 
      positively with improvement after treatment and at 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: 
      At the end of treatment, computer-aided CBT self-help at home via the internet plus 
      brief live helpline support was effective with or without exposure instructions, and 
      at 1-month follow-up it was more effective on some measures if exposure instructions 
      had been included. Analysis is needed of how non-exposure CBT produced its 
      shorter-term effect.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Seventy-five percent of patients with blood-injection-injury phobia 
      (BII-phobia) report a history of fainting in response to phobic stimuli. This 
      specificity may lead to medical conditions remaining undiagnosed and untreated, 
      incurring considerable cost for the individual and society. The psychophysiology of 
      BII-phobia remains poorly understood and the literature on effective treatments has 
      been fairly sparse. Aims of the systematic review: to synthesize the 
      psychophysiology of BII-phobia and to propose a systematic review of the literature 
      on effectiveness of different treatments evaluated in this indication. RESULTS: 
      Firstly, the most distinct feature of the psychophysiology of BII-phobia is its 
      culmination in a vasovagal syncope, which has been described as biphasic. The 
      initial phase involves a sympathetic activation as is typically expected from fear 
      responses of the fight-flight type. The second phase is characterized by a 
      parasympathetic activation leading to fainting, which is associated with disgust. 
      Subjects with syncope related to BII-phobia have an underlying autonomic 
      dysregulation predisposing them to neurally mediated syncope, even in the absence of 
      any blood or injury stimulus. Many studies report that BII-phobic individuals have a 
      higher level of disgust sensitivity than individuals without any phobia. Secondly, 
      behavioral psychotherapy techniques such as exposure only, applied relaxation, 
      applied tension, and tension only, have demonstrated efficacy with no significant 
      difference between all these techniques. The disgust induction has not improved 
      effectiveness of exposure. CONCLUSION: We have explained the psychophysiology of 
      BII-phobia, the understanding of which is required to study and validate specific 
      techniques, in order to improve the prognosis of this disorder, which is a public 
      health issue.

TI  - Psychological and pharmacological treatments of social phobia: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 311-24
AB  - A meta-analysis of psychological and pharmacological treatments for social phobia 
      was conducted to evaluate whether the various treatments differ in their efficacy 
      for treating social phobia, whether they are more effective than wait-list and 
      placebo controls, whether rates of attrition differ, and whether treatment gains are 
      maintained at follow-up. A total of 108 treatment-outcome trials for social phobia 
      met inclusion/exclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Eleven treatment conditions 
      were compared: wait-list control, pill placebo, benzodiazepines (BDZs), selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, attention 
      placebo, exposure (EXP), cognitive restructuring (CR), EXP plus CR, social skills 
      training, and applied relaxation. The most consistently effective treatments for 
      social phobia were pharmacotherapies. BDZs and SSRIs were equally effective and more 
      effective than control conditions. Dropout rates were similar among all the active 
      treatment conditions. Assessment of the durability of treatment gains for 
      pharmacotherapies was not possible because an insufficient number of drug studies 
      included follow-up data. The treatment gains of psychological therapies, although 
      moderate, continued during the follow-up period. BDZs and SSRIs seem to be effective 
      treatments for social phobia, at least in the short term. Recommendations for future 
      research include assessing the long-term outcome for pharmacotherapies and 
      evaluating the inclusion of a cognitive-behavioral treatment during the drug 
      tapering period.

TI  - BDNFval66met affects neural activation pattern during fear conditioning and 24 h 
      delayed fear recall.
PG  - 664-71
LID - 10.1093/scan/nsu102 [doi]
AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most abundant neutrophin in the 
      mammalian central nervous system, is critically involved in synaptic plasticity. In 
      both rodents and humans, BDNF has been implicated in hippocampus- and 
      amygdala-dependent learning and memory and has more recently been linked to fear 
      extinction processes. Fifty-nine healthy participants, genotyped for the functional 
      BDNFval66met polymorphism, underwent a fear conditioning and 24h-delayed extinction 
      protocol while skin conductance and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) 
      responses (functional magnetic resonance imaging) were acquired. We present the 
      first report of neural activation pattern during fear acquisition 'and' extinction 
      for the BDNFval66met polymorphism using a differential conditioned stimulus (CS)+ > 
      CS- comparison. During conditioning, we observed heightened allele dose-dependent 
      responses in the amygdala and reduced responses in the subgenual anterior cingulate 
      cortex in BDNFval66met met-carriers. During early extinction, 24h later, we again 
      observed heightened responses in several regions ascribed to the fear network in 
      met-carriers as opposed to val-carriers (insula, amygdala, hippocampus), which 
      likely reflects fear memory recall. No differences were observed during late 
      extinction, which likely reflects learned extinction. Our data thus support previous 
      associations of the BDNFval66met polymorphism with neural activation in the fear and 
      extinction network, but speak against a specific association with fear extinction 
      processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in reducing disability 
      among youth with juvenile fibromyalgia (FM); however, engagement in moderate to 
      vigorous physical activity remains poor, even after CBT. The purpose of this study 
      was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of an innovative program 
      combining CBT with specialized neuromuscular exercise: the Fibromyalgia Integrative 
      Training for Teens (FIT Teens) program. METHODS: Adolescents with juvenile FM 
      (n = 22, all female, ages 12-18 years) from 2 urban children's hospitals 
      participated in the 8-week FIT Teens intervention. Participants completed measures 
      of pain intensity, functional disability, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, 
      fear of movement, and readiness to change at baseline and after the intervention. 
      RESULTS: The feasibility of the intervention across 2 sites was documented, 
      including high retention rates (80%). Participants showed significant decreases in 
      functional disability (P < 0.05), depression (P < 0.001), fear of movement 
      (P < 0.01), and pain catastrophizing (P < 0.001) from pre- to postintervention. 
      Results of the readiness to change measure indicated a significant decrease in 
      precontemplation (P < 0.01) and increase in action/maintenance scores (P < 0.001). 
      All results demonstrated medium to large effect sizes. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with 
      juvenile FM reported significant improvements in physical function and reduced fear 
      of movement following the intervention. Improvement in physical function was 
      achieved in a shorter time frame than in a prior trial of CBT without an exercise 
      component. Further work is needed to compare the FIT Teens program with existing 
      approaches and determine whether objective changes in exercise participation are 
      achieved.

TI  - Adapting CBT for traumatized refugees and ethnic minority patients: examples from 
      culturally adapted CBT (CA-CBT).
PG  - 340-65
LID - 10.1177/1363461512441595 [doi]
AB  - In this article, we illustrate how cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be adapted 
      for the treatment of PTSD among traumatized refugees and ethnic minority 
      populations, providing examples from our treatment, culturally adapted CBT, or 
      CA-CBT. CA-CBT has a unique approach to exposure (typical exposure is poorly 
      tolerated in these groups), emphasizes the treatment of somatic sensations (a 
      particularly salient part of the presentation of PTSD in these groups), and 
      addresses comorbid anxiety disorders and anger. To accomplish these treatment goals, 
      CA-CBT emphasizes emotion exposure and emotion regulation techniques such as 
      meditation and aims to promote emotional and psychological flexibility. We describe 
      12 key aspects of adapting CA-CBT that make it a culturally sensitive treatment of 
      traumatized refugee and ethnic minority populations. We discuss three models that 
      guide our treatment and that can be used to design culturally sensitive treatments: 
      (a) the panic attack-PTSD model to illustrate the many processes that generate PTSD 
      in these populations, highlighting the role of arousal and somatic symptoms; (b) the 
      arousal triad to demonstrate how somatic symptoms are produced and the importance of 
      targeting comorbid anxiety conditions and psychopathological processes; and (c) the 
      multisystem network (MSN) model of emotional state to reveal how some of our 
      therapeutic techniques (e.g., body-focused techniques: bodily stretching paired with 
      self-statements) bring about psychological flexibility and improvement.

TI  - Pre- and post-natal melatonin administration partially regulates brain oxidative 
      stress but does not improve cognitive or histological alterations in the Ts65Dn 
      mouse model of Down syndrome.

AB  - Melatonin administered during adulthood induces beneficial effects on cognition and 
      neuroprotection in the Ts65Dn (TS) mouse model of Down syndrome. Here, we 
      investigated the effects of pre- and post-natal melatonin treatment on behavioral 
      and cognitive abnormalities and on several neuromorphological alterations 
      (hypocellularity, neurogenesis impairment and increased oxidative stress) that 
      appear during the early developmental stages in TS mice. Pregnant TS females were 
      orally treated with melatonin or vehicle from the time of conception until the 
      weaning of the offspring, and the pups continued to receive the treatment from 
      weaning until the age of 5 months. Melatonin administered during the pre- and 
      post-natal periods did not improve the cognitive impairment of TS mice as measured 
      by the Morris Water maze or fear conditioning tests. Histological alterations, such 
      as decreased proliferation (Ki67+ cells) and hippocampal hypocellularity (DAPI+ 
      cells), which are typical in TS mice, were not prevented by melatonin. However, 
      melatonin partially regulated brain oxidative stress by modulating the activity of 
      the primary antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase in the cortex and catalase in 
      the cortex and hippocampus) and slightly decreasing the levels of lipid peroxidation 
      in the hippocampus of TS mice. These results show the inability of melatonin to 
      prevent cognitive impairment in TS mice when it is administered at pre- and 
      post-natal stages. Additionally, our findings suggest that to induce pro-cognitive 
      effects in TS mice during the early stages of development, in addition to 
      attenuating oxidative stress, therapies should aim to improve other altered 
      processes, such as hippocampal neurogenesis and/or hypocellularity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Self-rated health (SRH) has been shown to be a stable predictor of 
      illness and mortality. Improvement in SRH, even in the absence of change in 
      objective health, predicts better health and reduced mortality. Severe health 
      anxiety (SHA) is characterized by fear of illness and distorted health perception. 
      The objective of the present study was to investigate if exposure-based cognitive 
      behavior therapy (CBT) for SHA can lead to improvement in SRH and whether this 
      improvement is mediated by reduced health anxiety. METHODS: Data were collected from 
      a randomized controlled trial where participants with SHA were allocated to 12weeks 
      of exposure-based CBT (n=99) for SHA or to a no treatment control condition (n=33). 
      The mediation analysis was based on SRH- and health anxiety data collected weekly 
      during the treatment phase. RESULTS: Linear mixed effects models analysis showed a 
      significant interaction effect of group and time indicating superior improvements in 
      SRH in exposure-based CBT compared to the control condition (Z=2.69, p=0.007). The 
      controlled effect size was moderately large (d=0.64) and improvements were stable at 
      1-year follow-up. Reduced health anxiety was a significant mediator of improvement 
      in SRH. CONCLUSIONS: 12weeks of exposure-based CBT for SHA can lead to significant 
      improvements in SRH. Considering the previously established importance of SRH as a 
      predictor for disease and mortality, exposure-based CBT for severe health anxiety 
      may lead to improvements on several important health parameters, possibly even 
      increasing the likelihood of longevity.

TI  - A controlled study of cognitive behaviour therapy with buspirone or placebo in panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia.
PG  - 635-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: This multicentre study compared a 16-week buspirone treatment with 
      placebo in patients presenting with panic disorder with agoraphobia and also 
      receiving cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). METHOD: Double-blind testing was 
      maintained until week 68, but not tested; 91 patients were included; 14 
      placebo-responders excluded; 77 patients randomised; 48 reached week 16 and 41 
      reached week 68. RESULTS: At week 16, within-group analysis showed significant 
      improvements in agoraphobia, panic attacks, and depression in both groups. 
      Generalised anxiety improved only in CBT+buspirone. Between-group comparisons showed 
      buspirone to have an effect on generalised anxiety and agoraphobia. Changes in 
      degree of agoraphobia and depression were correlated in subjects on CBT+buspirone 
      only. A significantly higher proportion of women, and of subjects showing high 
      avoidance dropped out. Positive expectations regarding medication predicted success 
      in both groups. At week 68, improvement was retained without significant buspirone 
      effect. CONCLUSION: Buspirone enhanced the effects of cognitive behaviour therapy on 
      generalised anxiety and agoraphobia in the short term.

TI  - Treatment of intra-oral injection phobia: a randomized delayed intervention 
      controlled trial among Norwegian 10- to 16-year-olds.
PG  - 294-301

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of five sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy 
      (CBT) for 10- to 16-year-olds with intra-oral injection phobia. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: This was a randomized delayed intervention controlled trial in 67 patients, 
      fulfilling the DSM-5 criteria for specific phobia. All patients received the same 
      CBT performed by dentists specially trained in CBT. The patients were randomly 
      assigned to either an immediate treatment group (ITG) (34 patients) or a 
      waitlist-control group (WCG) (33 patients). The WCG was put on a waitlist for 5 
      weeks. After treatment, all patients were combined for post-treatment analyses. 
      Assessments including the psychometric self-report scales Intra-oral injection fear 
      scale (IOIF-s), Children's Fear Survey Schedule-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS), Injection 
      Phobia Scale for children (IS-c) and Mutilation Questionnaire for children (MQ-c) 
      and a behavioural avoidance test (BAT) followed by a questionnaire on cognitions 
      during the BAT, occurred pre-, post-treatment/waitlist and at a 1-year follow-up. 
      RESULTS: CBT had a significant effect compared to no treatment (WCG). After 
      treatment, the scores on the psychometric self-report scales were significantly 
      reduced and higher levels in the BAT were achieved. The results were maintained at 
      1-year follow-up. Of the 67 patients, 70.1% received intra-oral injections during 
      CBT treatment, whereas 69.4% of those completing the CBT, in need for further dental 
      treatment, managed to receive the necessary intra-oral injections at their regular 
      dentist. CONCLUSIONS: The 10- to 16-year-olds diagnosed with intra-oral injection 
      phobia benefitted positively on CBT performed by specially trained dentists.

TI  - Effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy on brain responses to subliminal and 
      supraliminal threat and their functional significance in specific phobia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurocircuitry models of anxiety disorders suggest dysregulated 
      mechanisms encompassing both automatic and elaborate threat processing. However, the 
      extent to which these processes might be differentially modified by psychotherapy 
      and the neural basis of such changes are unknown. We examined the effects of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with anxiety disorder on brain 
      responses to subliminal and supraliminal threat. METHODS: 3-Tesla functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess neural responses to disorder-related 
      stimuli, presented during two backward-masking conditions employed to manipulate 
      stimulus awareness. In 28 spider-phobic patients randomly assigned to a therapy 
      group or a waiting-list control group scanning was performed before and after 
      completing CBT or a waiting period. Scanning was performed one time in 16 healthy 
      control subjects. Self-report and behavioral measures were used to relate 
      CBT-mediated brain activation changes with symptom improvement. RESULTS: Untreated 
      patients demonstrated abnormal hyperactivation in the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, 
      insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Successful CBT 
      was reflected in an overall downregulation in these fear circuitry structures, 
      especially in the right amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, with reductions in 
      amygdala responsiveness associated with self-reported symptom improvement. However, 
      subliminal threat induced a pattern of right-lateralized hyperactivation in the 
      amygdala and fusiform gyrus that was subject to intersession habituation across 
      groups without showing significant sensitivity to CBT. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      challenge prevailing models that emphasize a role for amygdala automaticity in the 
      maintenance of anxiety. Our results suggest CBT-related changes in neural activation 
      associated with fear responses to consciously perceived threat.

TI  - Sleep quality predicts treatment outcome in CBT for social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 1114-20
LID - 10.1002/da.22170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep quality may be an important, yet relatively neglected, predictor 
      of treatment outcome in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders. 
      Specifically, poor sleep quality may impair memory consolidation of in-session 
      extinction learning. We therefore examined sleep quality as a predictor of treatment 
      outcome in CBT for social anxiety disorder and the impact of d-cycloserine (DCS) on 
      this relationship. METHODS: One hundred sixty-nine participants with a primary 
      diagnosis of DSM-IV generalized social anxiety disorder were recruited across three 
      sites. Participants were enrolled in 12 weeks of group CBT. Participants randomly 
      received 50 mg of DCS (n = 87) or pill placebo (n = 82) 1 hr prior to sessions 3-7. 
      Participants completed a baseline measure of self-reported sleep quality and daily 
      diaries recording subjective feelings of being rested upon wakening. Outcome 
      measures including social anxiety symptoms and global severity scores were assessed 
      at each session. RESULTS: Poorer baseline sleep quality was associated with slower 
      improvement and higher posttreatment social anxiety symptom and severity scores. 
      Moreover, patients who felt more "rested" after sleeping the night following a 
      treatment session had lower levels of symptoms and global severity at the next 
      session, controlling for their symptoms and severity scores the previous session. 
      Neither of these effects were moderated by DCS condition. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      suggest that poor sleep quality diminishes the effects of CBT for social anxiety 
      disorder and this relation is not attenuated by DCS administration. Therapeutic 
      attention to sleep quality prior to initiation of CBT and during the acute treatment 
      phase may be clinically indicated.

TI  - Group cognitive behavior therapy for Japanese patients with social anxiety disorder: 
      preliminary outcomes and their predictors.
PG  - 69
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of studies have provided strong evidence for the use of 
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in the treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD). 
      However, all of the previous reports were from Europe and North America and it is 
      unknown whether Western psychological therapies are effective for SAD in non-Western 
      cultures. The present pilot study aimed to evaluate CBT program for SAD which was 
      originally developed for Western patients, among Japanese patients. METHODS: 
      Fifty-seven outpatients who participated in group CBT for SAD were evaluated using 
      eight self-reported and one clinician-administered questionnaires to measure various 
      aspects of SAD symptomatology at the beginning and at the end of the program. Pre- 
      and post-treatment scores were compared and the magnitude of treatment effect was 
      quantified as well based once on the intention-to-treat (ITT) and once among the 
      completers only. We also examined baseline predictors of the CBT outcomes. RESULTS: 
      Seven patients (12%) did not complete the program. For the ITT sample, the 
      percentage of reduction was 20% to 30% and the pre to post treatment effect sizes 
      ranged from 0.37 to 1.01. Among the completers, the respective figures were 20% to 
      33% and 0.41 to 1.19. We found no significant pretreatment predictor of the 
      outcomes. CONCLUSION: Group CBT for SAD is acceptable and can bring about a similar 
      degree of symptom reduction among Japanese patients with SAD as among Western 
      patients.

TI  - The recurrent pain and sexual sequelae of provoked vestibulodynia: a perpetuating 
      cycle.
PG  - 2077-92

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Optimal management of provoked vestibulodynia (PVD), thought to be the 
      most common form of chronic dyspareunia, is unclear. AIM: To integrate recent brain 
      data on chronic pain circuitry with stress-induced neuroendocrine mechanisms in the 
      skin and the stress burden (allostatic load) of women with PVD; to also clarify the 
      typical chronicity and negative sexual sequelae associated with PVD; and then review 
      modulation of pain circuitry by cognitive therapy and mindfulness practice and apply 
      to PVD management. Methods.  Review of scientific publications in the areas of 
      sexual medicine, pain, brain imaging, gynecology, stress response, mindfulness, and 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) A model of PVD to 
      reflect its etiology, typical chronicity, and the detrimental effects on sexual 
      function; (ii) Interventions of sexual rehabilitation based on principles underlying 
      changes associated with CBT and mindfulness practice. RESULTS: A model emerges which 
      reflects how stress-induced changes of pain amplification (central sensitization), 
      characteristic of chronic pain conditions, may impair sexual response in addition to 
      sexual dysfunction that arises from conscious pain avoidance and/or fear-related 
      inattention to sexual cues. Stress from low self-acceptance may be a major component 
      of the allostatic load present in women with PVD, only to be exacerbated by the 
      sexual dysfunction precipitated by the pain of intercourse. Mindfulness-based CBT 
      appears promising to target both the pain and sexual suffering from PVD. CONCLUSION:

TI  - Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral group therapy for panic disorder in a 
      specialized unit.
PG  - 176-84
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy for panic disorder (PD) 
      with or without agoraphobia is well established, but few data exist on its 
      effectiveness using a group format. The goal of the present study was to assess the 
      effectiveness of group CBT in a sample of PD patients in a specialized unit. 
      METHODS: Treatment consisted of nine weekly group sessions. Patients with PD (n=56) 
      were assessed at baseline, after the treatment and in one and three-months 
      followups. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in panic/agoraphobia symptoms 
      and related variables between baseline and post-treatment, and these reductions were 
      maintained in three-month follow-up. No differences were observed between those 
      patients who received only CBT and those who received pharmacological treatment as 
      well as CBT. Only initial panic/agoraphobia symptoms were significant predictors of 
      treatment response at the end of treatment (a greater severity was associated with a 
      worse response to CBT). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that group CBT in a 
      specialized unit is effective for PD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In anxiety disorders, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) 
      improves information-processing biases such as implicit fear evaluations and 
      avoidance tendencies, which predicts treatment response. Thus, these cognitive 
      biases might constitute important treatment targets. This study investigated (i) 
      whether information-processing biases could be changed following single-session 
      computerised CBT for spider fear, and (ii) whether this effect could be augmented by 
      administration of D-cycloserine (DCS). METHODS: Spider-fearful individuals were 
      randomized to receiving either 250 mg of DCS (n = 21) or placebo (n = 17). Three 
      hours after drug administration, they received single-session computerized CBT, 
      characterized by psychoeducation and exposure elements. Spider fear was assessed 
      using self-report, behavioural, and information processing (Extrinsic Affective 
      Simon Task & Approach Avoidance Task) measures at baseline (before drug 
      administration), post-treatment, 1-day, and 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Linear 
      mixed-effects analyses indicated significant improvements on self-report and 
      behavioural spider fear indices following CBT, but not on cognitive bias measures. 
      There was no evidence of an augmentation effect of DCS on any outcome. Cognitive 
      bias measures at 1-day were not predictive of 1-month follow-up spider fear in 
      adjusted linear regression analyses. LIMITATIONS: Results might be biased by limited 
      representativeness of the sample (high education and intelligence, largely Caucasian 
      ethnicity, young age). The study was also only powered for detection of medium-sized 
      DCS effects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not provide evidence for 
      information-processing biases relating to treatment outcome following computerised 
      CBT for spider fear or augmentation with DCS.

TI  - Clinical and cost-effectiveness of one-session treatment (OST) versus multisession 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for specific phobias in children: protocol for a 
      non-inferiority randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e025031

LID - e025031
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Specific phobias (intense, enduring fears of an object or situation 
      that lead to avoidance and severe distress) are highly prevalent among children and 
      young people. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a well-established, effective 
      intervention, but it can be time consuming and costly because it is routinely 
      delivered over multiple sessions during several months. Alternative methods of 
      treating severe and debilitating phobias in children are needed, like one-session 
      treatment (OST), to reduce time and cost, and to prevent therapeutic drift and help 
      children recover quickly. Our study explores whether (1) outcomes with OST are 'no 
      worse' than outcomes with multisession CBT, (2) OST is acceptable to children, their 
      parents and the practitioners who use it and (3) OST offers good value for money to 
      the National Health Service (NHS) and to society. METHOD: A pragmatic, 
      non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial will compare OST with multisession 
      CBT-based therapy on their clinical and cost-effectiveness. The primary clinical 
      outcome is a standardised behavioural task of approaching the feared stimulus at 6 
      months postrandomisation. The outcomes for the within-trial cost-effectiveness 
      analysis are quality-adjusted life years based on EQ-5D-Y, and individual-level 
      costs based of the intervention and use of health and social service care. A nested 
      qualitative evaluation will explore children's, parents' and practitioners' 
      perceptions and experiences of OST. A total of 286 children, 7-16 years old, with 
      DSM-IV diagnoses of specific phobia will be recruited via gatekeepers in the NHS, 
      schools and voluntary youth services, and via public adverts. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The trial received ethical approval from North East and York Research 
      Ethics Committee (Reference: 17/NE/0012). Dissemination plans include publications 
      in peer-reviewed journals, presentations in relevant research conferences, local 
      research symposia and seminars for children and their families, and for 
      professionals and service managers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

AB  - Disorder-specific cognitive behavior therapy (DS-CBT) is effective at treating major 
      depressive disorder (MDD) while transdiagnostic CBT (TD-CBT) addresses both 
      principal and comorbid disorders by targeting underlying and common symptoms. The 
      relative benefits of these two models of therapy have not been determined. 
      Participants with MDD (n=290) were randomly allocated to receive an internet 
      delivered TD-CBT or DS-CBT intervention delivered in either clinician-guided 
      (CG-CBT) or self-guided (SG-CBT) formats. Large reductions in symptoms of MDD 
      (Cohen's d≥1.44; avg. reduction≥45%) and moderate-to-large reductions in symptoms of 
      comorbid generalised anxiety disorder (Cohen's d≥1.08; avg. reduction≥43%), social 
      anxiety disorder (Cohen's d≥0.65; avg. reduction≥29%) and panic disorder (Cohen's 
      d≥0.45; avg. reduction≥31%) were found. No marked or consistent differences were 
      observed across the four conditions, highlighting the efficacy of different forms of 
      CBT at treating MDD and comorbid disorders.

AB  - Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with aberrant anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC) response to threat distractors. Perceptual load has been 
      shown to modulate ACC activity such that under high load, when demands on processing

      threat distractors yet under low load, there is evidence of reduced activation. It 
      is not known if neural predictors of response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 
      based on such emotional conflict resolution, interact with demands on controlled 
      processes. Prior to CBT, 32 patients with gSAD completed an fMRI task involving a 
      target letter in a string of identical targets (low perceptual load) or a target 
      letter in a mixed letter string (high perceptual load) superimposed on fearful, 
      angry and neutral face distractors. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses revealed better 
      CBT outcome was predicted by more frontopartial activity that included dorsal ACC 
      (dACC) and insula to threat (vs neutral) distractors during high, but not low, 
      perceptual load. Psychophysiological interaction analysis with dACC as the seed 
      region revealed less connectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to threat 
      distractors during high load. Results indicate patients with less regulatory 
      capability when demands on higher-order control are great may benefit more from CBT.

AB  - PURPOSE: The study sought to evaluate the longer-term effects of a brief cognitive 
      behavior therapy (CBT) intervention for patients with chronic subjective dizziness 
      (CSD). In addition, it sought to identify predictors of longer-term disability in 
      this group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with CSD referred by a 
      neuro-otological clinic were followed-up six months after completing a brief 
      treatment program based on the CBT model of panic disorder. Patients completed the 
      following measures: Dizziness Handicap Inventory, Depression, Anxiety and Stress 
      Scales, Dizziness Symptoms Inventory, and the Safety Behaviours Inventory. Measures 
      were completed at pre and post-treatment, as well as at one and six months 
      post-treatment. RESULTS: Treatment gains observed immediately after treatment were 
      maintained at one and six months post-treatment. High levels of pre-treatment 
      anxiety predicted higher levels of disability at six months post-treatment. Duration 
      and severity of dizziness, and medical or psychiatric comorbidity did not predict 
      disability at six month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A brief CBT intervention for 
      patients with CSD produced improvements in physical symptoms, disability, and 
      functional impairment which were sustained at one month and six months post 
      intervention. Patients with high levels of anxiety prior to treatment had higher 
      levels of disability at six months post-treatment. It is possible that more focused 
      interventions that specifically target anxiety might produce further benefits for 
      this cohort.

TI  - Cognitive Therapy and Task Concentration Training Applied as Intensified Group 
      Therapies for Social Anxiety Disorder with Fear of Blushing-A Randomized Controlled 
      Trial.
PG  - 509-522
LID - 10.1002/cpp.1975 [doi]
AB  - The current study examines the efficacy of intensified group therapy for social 
      anxiety disorder with fear of blushing. Task concentration training (TCT) and 
      cognitive therapy (CT) were applied during one weekend and compared with a waiting 
      list condition in a randomized controlled trial including 82 patients. On a second 
      weekend, another intervention was added (resulting in TCT-CT and CT-TCT sequences) 
      to examine order effects. Task concentration training and CT were both superior to 
      the waiting list and equally effective after the first therapy weekend. Also, no 
      differences were found between the sequences TCT-CT and CT-TCT at post-assessment. 
      At 6- and 12-month follow-up, effects remained stable or further improved. At the 
      6-month follow-up, remission rates in completers, established by diagnostic status, 
      were between 69% and 73%. Intensified group therapy is highly effective in treating 
      social anxiety disorder with fear of blushing. Group formats for patients sharing a 
      common primary concern may contribute to the dissemination of cognitive-behavioural 
      therapy. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: This 
      study focuses on blushing from fearful individuals within the SAD spectrum to 
      improve evidence for treatment efficacy in those whose social fears are centred 
      around observable bodily sensations. This study integrates task concentration 
      training into the SAD model of Clark and Wells to combine two evidence-based 
      treatments for SAD under one treatment model. This study uses an innovative format 
      of brief, intensified group therapy, conducted on two full-day weekend group 
      sessions delivered over two weekends, with strong observed effect sizes.

LID - 10.17992/lbl.2011.11.398 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents that form of psychotherapy which has 
      most research data to build on in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders for 
      adults. In this review we will introduce CBT and present the results of pertinent 
      outcome research. Efficacy at the end of treatment is discussed, as well as long 
      term effectiveness and the efficacy of combined treatment with medication and CBT. 
      In addition, we discuss the pros and cons of group CBT compared to CBT in individual 
      format, and comorbidity of mental disorders. According to this review CBT is 
      efficacious for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic 
      disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social 
      phobia and specific phobia. Efficacy of CBT is equal to or better than efficacy of 
      drugs in the treatment of the above disorders, but there is less access to CBT. 
      Longterm effectiveness of CBT appears to be good, but research on combined treatment 
      is yet in its infancy and conclusions are premature on its place in treatment. Key 
      words: Cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotropic treatment, efficacy, long-term 
      effects, combined treatment, mental disorders, adults.

TI  - Neurobiology of anxiety disorders and implications for treatment.
PG  - 941-9
AB  - The neurobiology of the anxiety disorders, which include panic disorder, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and specific phobias, among others, has been 
      clarified by advances in the field of classical or Pavlovian conditioning, and in 
      our understanding of basic mechanisms of memory and learning. Fear conditioning 
      occurs when a neutral conditioned stimulus (such as a tone) is paired with an 
      aversive, or unconditioned stimulus (such as a footshock), and then in the absence 
      of the unconditioned stimulus, causes a conditioned fear response. Preclinical 
      studies have shown that the amygdala plays a key role in fear circuitry, and that 
      abnormalities in amygdala pathways can affect the acquisition and expression of fear 
      conditioning. Drugs such as glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, and 
      blockers of voltage-gated calcium channels, in the amygdala, may block these 
      effects. There is also preliminary evidence for the use of centrally acting 
      beta-adrenergic antagonists, like propranolol, to inhibit consolidation of traumatic 
      memories in PTSD. Finally, fear extinction, which entails new learning of fear 
      inhibition, is central to the mechanism of effective anti-anxiety treatments. 
      Several pharmacological manipulations, such as D-cycloserine, a partial NMDA 
      agonist, have been found to facilitate extinction. Combining these medication 
      approaches with psychotherapies that promote extinction, such as cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT), may offer patients with anxiety disorders a rapid and 
      robust treatment with good durability of effect.

TI  - Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
PG  - CD004690
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004690.pub4 [doi]
LID - CD004690
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous Cochrane review (James 2005) showed that cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; 
      however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus non-CBT 
      active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and the 
      combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long-term effects of 
      CBT.  OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood 
      and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait-list controls; (b) 
      active non-CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, bibliotherapy and treatment 
      as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the combination of medication and CBT versus 
      placebo; and (2) the long-term effects of CBT. SEARCH METHODS: Searches for this 
      review included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the 
      Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant 
      randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases－The Cochrane Library 
      (1970 to July 2012), EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and 
      PsycINFO (1970 to July 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of CBT versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were 
      reviewed. All participants must have met the criteria of the Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for 
      an anxiety diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder and elective mutism. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers 
      independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the 
      odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects model, 
      with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was used. 
      Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child's anxiety symptoms 
      were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one 
      studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies 
      involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in 
      university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of 
      remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, 
      intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR 
      of 7.85 (95% CI 5.31 to 11.60, Z = 10.26, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate 
      heterogeneity (P = 0.04, I² = 33%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 6.0 (95% CI 
      7.5 to 4.6). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and 
      family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than 
      non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing 
      anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow-up 
      studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis 
      are not statistically significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural 
      therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; 
      however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or 
      TAU or medication at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive.

TI  - Oral health and its influence on cognitive behavioral therapy in patients fulfilling 
      the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria for intra-oral 
      injection phobia.
PG  - 98-105
LID - 10.3109/00016350903512792 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe self-perceived and clinically assessed oral health and oral 
      treatment needs among intra-oral injection-phobic patients (Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV) and to explore whether these factors have 
      an impact on the outcome of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Fifty-five patients (43 women, mean age 32.5 years, range 18-62 years) were 
      treated with short-duration CBT. Dental anxiety (Dental Anxiety Scale and Dental 
      Fear Survey) and self-perceived oral health were assessed by means of 
      questionnaires. Three dentists assessed oral health by means of clinical examination 
      and radiographs. Treatment outcome was measured by ability to receive an intra-oral 
      injection by a general dentist within a 1-year follow-up (FU) period or ability to 
      complete a behavioral avoidance test (BAT) at FU, and changes in dental anxiety and 
      positive and negative thoughts from pretreatment to FU. RESULTS: Forty percent of 
      patients ranged their oral health as "good" or "very good". Mean decayed teeth (DT) 
      was 2.2 (range 0-15). The total number of teeth in need of treatment, periodontal 
      treatment, endodontic treatment and extractions ranged from 0 to 15, 0 to 19, 0 to 4 
      and 0 to 5, respectively. Self-rated oral health correlated significantly with 
      clinical oral health. The outcome of CBT in terms of being able to receive a dental 
      injection during FU was not influenced by oral health status. However, correlation 
      analyses indicated that patients with the poorest oral health had the greatest 
      increase in positive thoughts and the greatest decrease in negative thoughts from 
      pretreatment to FU. CONCLUSIONS: The oral health of intra-oral injection-phobic 
      patients varies substantially, but is comparable to that of the normal population. 
      Coping with a dental injection after CBT is not influenced by oral health and 
      treatment needs.

AB  - Around 7% of pregnant women suffer from blood- and injection phobia. The aim was to 
      investigate if cognitive behavior group therapy (CBT) is effective in treating 
      pregnant women's blood- and injection phobia. Thirty pregnant women with blood- and 
      injection phobia according to DSM-IV took part in an open treatment intervention. A 
      two-session cognitive behavior group therapy was conducted. As controls, 46 pregnant 
      women with untreated blood- and injection phobia and 70 healthy pregnant women were 
      used. Repeated measures ANOVA were performed. The scores for the CBT treatment group 
      on the "Injection Phobia Scale-Anxiety" were reduced both after each treatment 
      session and postpartum (p < 0.001). Anxiety and depressive symptoms were also 
      reduced (p < 0.001). Cognitive-behavior group therapy for pregnant women with blood- 
      and injection phobia is effective and stable up to at least 3 months postpartum. It 
      seems also to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms during pregnancy.

TI  - Panic disorder.
LID - 1010 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Panic disorder occurs in up to 3% of the adult population at some 
      time, and is associated with other psychiatric and personality disorders, and with 
      drug and alcohol abuse. The risk of suicide and attempted suicide has been found to 
      be higher in people with panic disorder than in people with other psychiatric 
      illness, including depression. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic 
      review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of 
      non-drug treatments for panic disorder? What are the effects of drug treatments for 
      panic disorder? What are the effects of combined drug and psychological treatments 
      for panic disorder? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other 
      important databases up to June 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated 
      periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this 
      review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food 
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products 
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 36 systematic reviews, RCTs, or 
      observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE 
      evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of 
      the following interventions: applied relaxation, benzodiazepines, breathing 
      retraining, brief dynamic psychotherapy, buspirone, client-centred therapy, 
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (alone or plus drug treatments), cognitive 
      restructuring, couple therapy, exposure (external or interoceptive), 
      insight-orientated therapy, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), psychoeducation, 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), self-help, and tricyclic 
      antidepressants (imipramine).

TI  - A review of cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder in patients with chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease: the rationale for interoceptive exposure.
PG  - 144-54
LID - 10.1007/s10880-014-9393-4 [doi]
AB  - Panic disorder commonly co-occurs in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease (COPD), and translational interventions are needed to address the fear of 
      physiological arousal in this population. This paper examines the utility of 
      interoceptive exposures (IE), a key component of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      for panic disorder, in patients with comorbid panic and COPD. Our translational 
      review of the literature suggests that IE is supported by both cognitive- and 
      learning-theory perspectives of panic, and that the breathing exercises associated 
      with IE are safe and highly compatible with existing pulmonary rehabilitation 
      exercises for COPD. Unfortunately, few research studies have examined the use of CBT 
      to treat anxiety in COPD patients, and none have included IE. Given the strong 
      theoretical and empirical support for the use of IE, we suggest that mental health 
      providers should consider incorporating IE into CBT interventions for patients with 
      comorbid panic and COPD.

AB  - This analysis aims to identify and characterize symptom trajectories in primary care 
      patients with panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD/AG) who participated in a 
      primary care team based training involving elements of cognitive behavioural therapy 
      (CBT). Growth Mixture Modeling was used to identify different latent classes of 
      change in patients with PD/AG (N = 176) who underwent treatment including 
      CBT elements. We identified three patient classes with distinct similar 
      trajectories. Class 1 (n = 58, mean age: 46.2 years ± 13.4 years, 81% women) 
      consisted of patients with an initially high symptom burden, but symptoms declined 
      constantly over the intervention period. Symptoms of patients in class 2 (n = 89, 
      mean age: 44.2 years ± 14.5 years, 67.4% women) declined rapidly at the beginning, 
      then patients went into a plateau-phase. The third class (n = 29, mean age: 47.0 
      years ± 12.4 years, 65.5% women) was characterized by an unstable course and had the 
      worse outcome. Our findings show that only a minority did not respond to the 
      treatment. To identify this minority and refer to a specialist would help patients 
      to get intensive care in time.

TI  - Cognitive behavior therapy in panic disorder and comorbid major depression. A 
      naturalistic study.
PG  - 70-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of cognitive 
      behavior therapies (CBT) in settings of routine clinical care as well as in the 
      treatment of panic and comorbid disorders. METHODS: We investigated a group-oriented 
      CBT approach for 80 patients with panic disorder including 35 patients with current 
      comorbid major depression. Assessments took place 6 months before treatment, at the 
      beginning and end of treatment, and 1 year later. Structured interviews and multiple 
      clinical self-rating scales were used. RESULTS: Panic patients with comorbid major 
      depression showed higher anxiety-specific and nonspecific pathology. The most 
      striking benefits were in reducing avoidance behavior, while improvements concerning 
      catastrophic beliefs were smaller, but still significant. For most self-rating scale 
      results, patients with and without comorbid depression improved to a comparable 
      degree. However, the end-state functioning of patients with panic disorder and 
      current comorbid depression at admission is significantly lower than for patients 
      with panic disorder alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results point to the necessity to 
      develop and improve treatment approaches for patients with comorbidity of panic 
      disorder and current major depression.

      in the general population. The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
      social anxiety disorders is well demonstrated. However, only three studies point to 
      the efficacy of systemic therapy (ST) in anxiety disorders, and only two of them 
      especially focus on social anxiety disorders. These ST studies either do not use a 
      good comparator but minimal supportive therapy, they do not use a multi-person ST 
      but a combined therapy, or they do not especially focus on social anxiety disorders 
      but mood and anxiety disorders in general. Though ST was approved as evidence based 
      in Germany for a variety of disorders in 2008, evidence did not include anxiety 
      disorders. This is the first pilot study that will investigate multi-person ST, 
      integrating a broad range of systemic methods, specifically for social anxiety 
      disorders and that will compare ST to the "gold standard" CBT. DESIGN: This article 
      describes the rationale and protocol of a prospective, open, interventive, balanced, 
      bi-centric, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 32 patients with a 
      primary SCID diagnosis of social anxiety disorder will be randomized to either CBT 
      or ST. Both treatments will be manualized. The primary outcome will include social 
      anxiety symptoms at the end of therapy. Therapy will be restricted to no more than 
      26 hours (primary endpoint). Secondary outcomes will include psychological, social 
      systems and interpersonal functioning, symptom adjustment, and caregiver burden, in 
      addition to change measures, therapist variables and treatment adherence. At the 
      secondary endpoints, 9 and 12 months after the beginning of therapy, we will again 
      assess all outcomes. DISCUSSION: The study is expected to pilot test a RCT which 
      will be the first to directly compare CBT and multi-person ST, integrating a broad 
      range of systemic methods, for social anxiety disorders, and it will provide 
      empirical evidence for the calculation of the number of patients needed for a 
      confirmatory RCT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02360033 ; date of 
      registration: 21 January 2015.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) versus psychodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of social anxiety disorder 
      after a follow-up of 30 months from a societal perspective. METHODS: This analysis 
      was conducted alongside the multicenter SOPHO-NET trial; adults with a primary 
      diagnosis of social anxiety disorder received CBT (n = 209) or PDT (n = 207). Data 
      on health care utilization and productivity loss were collected at baseline, after 6 
      months (posttreatment), and three further follow-ups to calculate direct and 
      indirect costs. Anxiety-free days (AFDs) calculated based on remission and response 
      were used as measure of effect. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
      determined. Net benefit regressions, adjusted for comorbidities and baseline 
      differences, were applied to derive cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. 
      RESULTS: In the descriptive analysis, the unadjusted ICER favored CBT over PDT and 
      the adjusted analysis showed that CBT's cost-effectiveness relative to PDT depends 
      on the willingness to pay (WTP) per AFD. As baseline costs differed substantially 
      the unadjusted estimates might be deceptive. If additional WTPs for CBT of €0, €10, 
      and €30 were assumed, the probability of CBT being cost-effective relative to PDT 
      was 65, 83, and 96%. Direct costs increased compared to baseline across groups, 
      whereas indirect costs did not change significantly. Results were sensitive to 
      considered costs. CONCLUSIONS: If the society is willing to pay ≥€30 per additional 
      AFD, CBT can be considered cost-effective, relative to PDT, with certainty. To 
      further increase the cost-effectiveness more knowledge regarding predictors of 
      treatment outcome seems essential.

TI  - Anxiety sensitivity as a predictor of broad dimensions of psychopathology after 
      cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder.
PG  - 1835-1840
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S121360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder (PD) is a common disease and presents with broad 
      dimensions of psychopathology. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to 
      improve these broad dimensions of psychopathology in addition to PD symptoms. 
      However, little is known about the predictors of treatment response in comorbid 
      psychiatric symptoms after CBT for PD. Recent studies suggest that anxiety 
      sensitivity (AS) may be a key vulnerability for PD. This study aimed to examine AS 
      as a predictor of broad dimensions of psychopathology after CBT for PD. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: In total, 118 patients with PD were treated with manualized group CBT. 
      We used multiple regression analysis to examine the associations between 3 Anxiety 
      Sensitivity Index (ASI) factors (physical concerns, mental incapacitation concerns, 
      and social concerns) at baseline and the subscales of the Symptom Checklist-90 
      Revised (SCL-90-R) at endpoint. RESULTS: Low levels of social concerns at baseline 
      predicted low levels on 5 SCL-90-R subscales after CBT: interpersonal sensitivity, 
      depression, hostility, paranoid ideation, and psychosis. High levels of mental 
      incapacitation concerns significantly predicted low levels on 3 SCL-90-R subscales 
      after treatment: interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and paranoid ideation. 
      Physical concerns at baseline did not predict broad dimensions of psychopathology. 
      CONCLUSION: This study suggested that the social concerns and mental incapacitation 
      concerns subscales of the ASI at baseline predicted several dimensions of 
      psychopathology after CBT for PD. To improve comorbid psychopathology, it may be 
      useful to direct more attention to these ASI subscales.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a 
      disproportionate impact on quality of life and carer burden. Pharmacological 
      treatment is the main approach in dealing with these symptoms, but it is limited by 
      variable efficacy and risk of drug interactions. Non-pharmacological approaches 
      using the cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) model are viable alternatives and in 
      this review paper we summarise the evidence of CBT for three of the most common 
      psychiatric manifestations of PD: depression and anxiety, impulse-control disorders 
      and insomnia. Most studies modified the usual CBT format to include modules 
      accounting for problems specific to PD: activity scheduling around motoric function, 
      motor symptoms as triggers of anxiety, fear of falling and preparation for disease 
      progression as well as accommodation of materials for suspected executive 
      dysfunction. We found a growing evidence base that CBT (modified to account for 
      PD-specific problems) is effective in the treatment of PD psychiatric symptoms. 
      Where controlled study design was used, moderate effect sizes are reported for the 
      efficacy of CBT for depression, including with distance administration of CBT. The 
      effects were sustained during follow-up which was between 1 and 6 months. In 
      addition, there are some initial data on the effects of CBT on impulse-control 
      disorders and insomnia. The studies were limited by their small and potentially 
      unrepresentative samples and the quality of sample reporting (eg, concomitant 
      antidepressant and dopaminergic therapy use). Additional well-designed and 
      adequately powered studies are required to determine the utility of CBT in PD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of adverse events (AEs) across 4 treatment 
      conditions in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), and to compare 
      the frequency of AEs between children and adolescents. METHOD: Participants ages 7 
      to 17 years (mean = 10.7 years) meeting the DSM-IV criteria for 1 or more of the 
      following disorders: separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or 
      social phobia were randomized (2:2:2:1) to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT, n = 
      139), sertraline (SRT, n = 133), a combination of both (COMB, n = 140), or pill 
      placebo (PBO, n = 76). Data on AEs were collected via a standardized inquiry method 
      plus a self-report Physical Symptom Checklist (PSC). RESULTS: There were no 
      differences between the double-blinded conditions (SRT versus PBO) for total 
      physical and psychiatric AEs or any individual physical or psychiatric AEs. The 
      rates of total physical AEs were greater in the SRT-alone treatment condition when 
      compared to CBT (p < .01) and COMB (p < .01). Moreover, those who received SRT alone 
      reported higher rates of several physical AEs when compared to COMB and CBT. The 
      rate of total psychiatric AEs was higher in children (≤12 years) across all arms 
      (31.7% versus 23.1%, p < .05). Total PSC scores decreased over time, with no 
      significant differences between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The results support 
      the tolerability/safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment 
      for anxiety disorders even after adjusting for the number of reporting 
      opportunities, leading to no differences in overall rates of AEs. Few differences 
      occurred on specific items. Additional monitoring of psychiatric AEs is recommended 
      in children (≤12 years). Clinical trial registration information-Child and 
      Adolescent Anxiety Disorders (CAMS); http://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00052078.

BTI - Internet-Based Psychological Treatment for Anxiety and Mood Disorders
AB  - It is not evident whether psychological treatment via the internet is non-inferior 
      to corresponding treatment by a therapist. Internet-based cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT), with the support of a therapist, reduces symptoms in adults with 
      social phobia or mild to moderate major depression, and who have themselves sought 
      this form of treatment. There is some evidence that this also applies to panic 
      disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. Most trials have compared the treatment 
      only with waiting lists and have short follow-up periods. Further trials are needed 
      to assess the effect of treatment in the longer term. Given our present level of 
      knowledge, internet-based CBT with therapist support may be considered as part of a 
      wider range of psychological methods for these conditions and mainly for patients 
      who are motivated to seek this form of treatment. Treatment costs for internet-based 
      CBT in the short term are probably lower than for CBT in a group or individually. 
      However, since the effects of these treatment alternatives have not been adequately 
      compared, it is not possible to ascertain which alternative is cost-effective. It is 
      important to investigate whether this type of treatment can reach people who are in 
      need of care but who are not currently being treated through ordinary health and 
      medical care. In order to further clarify what role internet-based treatment might 
      have in the care of anxiety and mood disorders, it is also important to clarify the 
      extent to which internet-based treatment is requested by patients. More and 
      larger-scale studies are required in order to assess: whether internet-based 
      psychological treatment has an effect that is non-inferior to that of established 
      psychological treatment methods; what risks might be involved in participating in 
      internet-based treatment; what effect internet-based psychological treatment has on 
      anxiety and mood disorders in children and adolescents; the effect of types of 
      internet-based psychological treatment other than CBT with therapist support; 
      whether there are groups of patients for whom treatment via the internet is more or 
      less appropriate.

AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven long-term effects in youth with 
      anxiety disorders. However, only a few studies have examined predictors of long-term 
      outcomes of CBT treatment. The present study investigated possible predictors of 
      long-term treatment outcomes in youth with mixed anxiety disorders treated in 
      community mental health clinics. A total of 139 youth (mean age at assessment 15.5 
      years, range 11-21 years) with a principal diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, 
      social anxiety disorder, and/or generalized anxiety disorder were evaluated a mean 
      of 3.9 years post-treatment (range 2.2-5.9 years). Outcomes were loss of all 
      inclusion anxiety diagnoses, loss of the principal inclusion anxiety diagnosis, and 
      changes in youth- and parent-rated youth anxiety symptoms. Predictors encompassed 
      youth, parent and demographic factors, and post-treatment recovery. The most 
      consistent finding was that low family social class predicted poorer outcomes. 
      Higher treatment motivation was associated with better outcome whereas a diagnosis 
      of social anxiety was associated with poorer outcome. Identified predictors extend 
      on previous findings from efficacy trials, and the results indicate a need for more 
      specific treatment protocols.

TI  - Augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies (CBT) with d-cycloserine for 
      anxiety and related disorders.
PG  - CD007803
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007803.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients who suffer with anxiety and related 
      disorders (that is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder 
      (SAnD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD), specific phobia (SPh) and 
      obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) fail to respond optimally to first-line 
      treatment with medication or cognitive and behavioural therapies. The addition of 
      d-cycloserine (DCS) to cognitive and behavioural therapies may improve treatment 
      response by impacting the glutamatergic system. This systematic review aimed to 
      investigate the effects of adding DCS to cognitive and behavioural therapies by 
      synthesising data from relevant randomised controlled trials and following the 
      guidelines recommended by Cochrane. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of DCS 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared to placebo augmentation 
      of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety and related 
      disorders. Additionally, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of DCS across 
      different anxiety and related disorders. SEARCH METHODS: This review fully 
      incorporates studies identified from a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety 
      and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 12 March 2015. This register 
      includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library 
      (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date), 
      the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov . 
      Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of RCTs were also checked. 
      No restrictions were placed on language, setting, date or publication status. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural 
      therapies versus placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for 
      anxiety and related disorders were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two 
      authors (RO and TA) independently assessed RCTs for eligibility and inclusion, 
      extracted outcomes and risk of bias data and entered these into a customised 
      extraction form. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. In addition, 
      data entry and analysis were performed by two review authors (KSW and HB). MAIN 
      RESULTS: Twenty-one published RCTs, with 788 participants in outpatient settings, 
      were included in the review. Sixteen studies had an age range of 18 to 75 years, 
      while four investigated paediatric populations aged 8 to 17 years and one included 
      children, adolescents and adults. The 21 RCTs investigated OCD (number of RCTs (N) = 
      6), PTSD (N = 5), SAnD (N = 5), SPh (N = 3) and PD (N = 2). Most information from 
      the studies was rated as having either low risk or unclear risk of bias.There was no 
      evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural 
      therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for the 
      treatment of anxiety and related disorders in adults at the endpoint (treatment 
      responders, N = 9, risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.34; 
      number of participants (n) = 449; low quality evidence) and between 1 and 12 months 
      follow-up (N = 7, RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31; n = 383). DCS augmentation of 
      cognitive and behavioural therapies was not superior to placebo augmentation of 
      cognitive and behavioural therapies for children and adolescents, both at the 
      endpoint (N = 4, RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; n = 121; low quality evidence) and 
      between 3 and 12 months follow-up (N = 3, RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.09; n = 
      91).There was no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability for DCS 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared with placebo 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in adults (N = 16, RR 0.88; 95% 
      CI 0.61 to 1.25; n = 740), nor in children and adolescents (N = 4, RR 0.90; 95% CI 
      0.17 to 4.69; n = 131). These conclusions were based on moderate quality evidence 
      for adults, and very low quality evidence for children and adolescents. Although the 
      observed difference was small, it is noteworthy that there was a high efficacy of 
      exposure-based therapies alone in the included trials. Due to the limited number of 
      studies, subgroup analysis of moderating factors for clinical and methodological 
      effect could not take place. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review found no evidence of 
      a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and 
      placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for treating anxiety and 
      related disorders in children, adolescents and adults. These findings are based on 
      low quality evidence from heterogenous studies with small sample sizes and 
      incomplete data for clinical response, which precludes us from drawing conclusions 
      on the use of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies at this stage. 
      Given there is some promising preliminary data from individual studies, further 
      research is necessary to assess DCS compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive 
      and behavioural therapies, and determine mechanisms of action as well as magnitude 
      of effect in anxiety and related disorders.

TI  - Australian and New Zealand clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of panic 
      disorder and agoraphobia.
PG  - 641-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is 
      co-ordinating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry, 
      funded under the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand 
      Health Funding Authority. METHOD: For these guidelines, the CPG team reviewed the 
      treatment outcome literature, consulted with practitioners and patients and 
      conducted a meta-analysis of recent outcome research. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: 
      Education for the patient and significant others covering: (i) the nature and course 
      of panic disorder and agoraphobia; (ii) an explanation of the psychopathology of 
      anxiety, panic and agoraphobia; (iii) rationale for the treatment, likelihood of a 
      positive response, and expected time frame. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is 
      more effective and more cost-effective than medication. Tricyclic antidepressants 
      (TCAs) and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors are equal in efficacy and both 
      are to be preferred to benzodiazepines. Treatment choice depends on the skill of the 
      clinician and the patient's circumstances. Drug treatment should be complemented by 
      behaviour therapy. If the response to an adequate trial of a first-line treatment is 
      poor, another evidence-based treatment should be used. A second opinion can be 
      useful. The presence of severe agoraphobia is a negative prognostic indicator, 
      whereas comorbid depression, if properly treated, has no consistent effect on 
      outcome.

PG  - 308-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the empirical status of psychological treatments for social 
      phobia (SP), commenting both on cognitive-behavioural interventions and on more 
      recent iterations of those approaches. We also review the effective components of 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). METHOD: We qualitatively reviewed the empirical 
      literature on the psychological treatment of SP. We include empirical studies, 
      metaanalyses, and recent conference presentations in this review. RESULTS: Cognitive 
      and behavioural interventions for SP appear to be more effective than wait-list 
      controls and supportive therapy. Comparisons of CBT and pharmacologic treatment have 
      produced inconsistent results. Several new treatments for SP demonstrate promising 
      results. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that various psychosocial treatments for SP 
      are better than wait-list controls and credible placebo interventions. Ongoing 
      projects investigate the relative efficacy of combining medication and psychosocial 
      treatments over monotherapies; this line of research is important to continue. 
      Further research should also focus on which components of CBT are most effective.

TI  - School-based interventions for anxious children.
PG  - 1118-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of three school-based interventions for 
      anxious children: group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for children, group CBT 
      for children plus parent training group, and no-treatment control. METHOD: Students 
      (7-11 years old) in three elementary schools (N = 453) were screened using the 
      Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and teacher nomination. Subsequently, 
      101 identified children and their parents completed the Anxiety Disorders Interview 
      Schedule for DSM-IV, Child Version. Children with features or DSM-IV diagnoses of 
      separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia (n = 
      61) were randomized by school to one of three conditions. Active treatments were 
      nine weekly sessions of either group CBT or group CBT plus concurrent parent 
      training. RESULTS: Clinician-report, child-report, and parent-report measures of 
      child anxiety demonstrated significant benefits of CBT treatments over the 
      no-treatment control group. Effect size was 0.58 for change in composite clinician 
      severity rating, the primary outcome measure, favoring collapsed CBT conditions 
      compared with control. In addition, several instruments showed significantly greater 
      improvement in child anxiety for group CBT plus parent training over group CBT 
      alone. CONCLUSIONS: Both active CBT treatments were more effective than the 
      no-treatment control condition in decreasing child anxiety symptoms and associated 
      impairment. When parent training was combined with child group CBT, there were some 
      additional benefits for the children.

      Amyloid Clearance after Transplantation of Lineage Negative Stem Cells.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the untreatable neurodegenerative disorders with 
      associated societal burden. Current therapies only provide symptomatic relief 
      without altering the rate of disease progression as reported by Lanctot et al. 
      (Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders 2 (3):163-180, 2009). The increased 
      number of failed clinical trials in last two decades indicates the imperative need 
      to explore alternative therapies for AD as reported by Tuszynski et al. (Nature 
      Medicine 11 (5):551-555, 2005) and Liyanage et al. (Alzheimer's & Dementia 
      4:628-635, 2005). In this study, we aimed to decipher the role of neurotrophic 
      factors in the reversal of memory loss by transplantation of lineage negative 
      (Lin-ve) stem cells in a male mouse model of cognitive impairment induced by 
      intrahippocampal injection of amyloid β-42 (Aβ-42). The efficacy of human umbilical 
      cord blood (hUCB) derived Lin-ve stem cells were analyzed by neurobehavioral 
      parameters, i.e., Morris water maze and passive avoidance after bilateral 
      intra-hippocampal transplantation using stereotaxic surgery. Real-time PCR and 
      immunohistochemistry was carried out in brain tissues in order to analyze the 
      expression of neurotrophic factors, apoptotic, astrocytic, and other neuronal cell 
      markers. The transplantation of Lin-ve stem cells led to reversal of memory loss 
      associated with reduction of Aβ-42 deposition from the brains. The molecular 
      analysis revealed increase in neurotrophic factors, i.e., glial derived neurotrophic 
      factor (GDNF), ciliary derived neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and Brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after transplantation. The administration of ANA-12, a 
      TrkB inhibitor, reversed the behavioral and molecular effects of stem cell 
      transplantation suggesting involvement of BDNF-TrkB pathway in the rescue of memory 
      loss. We believe that the amyloid clearance results from activation of astrocytes 
      and anti-apoptotic pathways added by neurotrophic factors.

AB  - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice for Social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD). However, factors additional to those emphasised in CBT are the 
      primary cause of psychological disorder according to the metacognitive model. 
      Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) aims to target a perseverative thinking style named the 
      cognitive attentional syndrome and its underlying metacognitive beliefs (beliefs 
      about cognition). The present study aimed to explore the effects of generic MCT for 
      SAD. Treatment related effects were evaluated using direct replication single case 
      (A-B) methodology across three patients with different subtypes of SAD; performance 
      type, generalised and generalised plus avoidant personality disorder, representing 
      increasing SAD severity/complexity. All patients responded during treatment and 
      achieved substantial symptom reductions which were largely maintained at 6 months' 
      follow-up. Metacognitive therapy appears to be a suitable treatment and was 
      associated with positive outcomes for patients with different presentations of SAD.

TI  - Using Virtual Reality Environments to Augment Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Fears 
      and Phobias in Autistic Adults.
PG  - 134-145
LID - 10.1089/aut.2018.0019 [doi]
AB  - Fears and phobias are common in people on the autism spectrum and can impact on 
      their ability to undertake usual daily activities. Graded exposure to the 
      anxiety-provoking stimulus is a recognized method of treatment for fears/phobias in 
      the nonautistic population but may pose specific difficulties for autistic people. 
      For example, real-life exposure can be too anxiety-provoking to allow treatment to 
      take place, and imaginal exposure can be problematic. To address this, we developed 
      an intervention that combines cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with immersive 
      virtual reality (VR) exposure to reduce anxiety. Following successful trials of this 
      intervention with young people on the autism spectrum, we report a pilot study using 
      the same intervention with autistic adults. Eight adults (aged 18-57 years) received 
      one psychoeducation session and then four 20-minute sessions of graded exposure with 
      a therapist in an immersive VR room (known as the Blue Room). Each participant 
      completed all sessions showing that the intervention is feasible and acceptable. 
      Outcomes were monitored at 6 weeks and 6 months postintervention. Five of the eight 
      participants were classified as intervention responders and at 6 months after the 
      end of intervention were experiencing real-life functional improvements. These 
      preliminary findings show that VR-graded exposure alongside CBT may be an effective 
      treatment for autistic people with phobias. LAY SUMMARY: Why was this study 
      done?Anxiety is common in autistic adults. For some people, fears and phobias 
      regarding everyday objects and situations occur frequently affecting everyday life. 
      The main method to treat fears and phobias for people without autism is gradual 
      exposure to the situation that causes anxiety. However, this method may be 
      challenging for people on the autism spectrum. We wanted to test a new method of 
      treatment that uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered with gradual 
      exposure in a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) environment.What was the purpose 
      of this study?We have already delivered this treatment successfully with autistic 
      children. We wanted to test if this treatment would work for autistic adults. 
      Changing traditional psychological treatments, such as CBT, to make it more suitable 
      for autistic people is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care 
      Excellence.What did the researchers do?We recruited eight autistic adults (aged 
      18-57 years) with a fear/phobia and their supporter (parent/friend/support worker). 
      Each adult had one session with a therapist to learn anxiety management techniques. 
      They then had four 20-minute sessions of graded exposure with a therapist in an 
      immersive VR room (known as the Blue Room). Each participant had a 
      computer-generated scene designed for their specific anxiety-provoking situation. 
      After four sessions, the participant tried real-life exposure with their supporter. 
      We measured progress at 6 weeks and 6 months after the last VR session.What were the 
      results of this study?Each participant completed all four sessions. This shows that 
      the intervention was possible to deliver and acceptable to autistic people and 
      therapists. Participants completed assessments at 6 weeks and 6 months after the VR 
      sessions. Five of the eight participants were "responders" to the intervention. This 
      means that 6 months after the last VR session, they still had real-life day-to-day 
      improvements in relation to their phobia.What do these findings add to what was 
      already known?We had not delivered this intervention to autistic adults previously. 
      The findings show that this VR intervention has the potential to be an effective 
      treatment for anxiety in autistic adults.What are the potential weaknesses in the 
      study?This is a small study and future work will be a larger trial of this 
      treatment-comparing results from people who get the intervention with people who do 
      not. We would also want to have an outcome assessor who did not know whether people 
      had received the intervention or not.How will these findings help autistic adults 
      now or in the future?This new intervention has the potential to help autistic adults 
      manage their anxiety in stressful situations and therefore may improve their quality 
      of life.

TI  - Study protocol of the SWORD-study: a randomised controlled trial comparing combined 
      online and face-to-face cognitive behaviour therapy versus treatment as usual in 
      managing fear of cancer recurrence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is one of the most frequently cited 
      problems by cancer survivors. More than one third report high FCR, which is a 
      clinical concern due to its association with negative health outcomes. The aim of 
      the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) 
      in reducing FCR in high fearful cancer survivors. METHODS/DESIGN: The SWORD-study 
      has a randomised controlled design with two arms. A sample of 104 high fearful 
      cancer survivors (breast, prostate or colorectal cancer) will be recruited from 
      local hospitals. Cancer survivors will be randomised to receive CBT (intervention 
      condition) or treatment as usual (control condition). For those in the intervention 
      condition, the therapy will be individually delivered in a combination of 5 
      face-to-face therapy sessions and 3 online or telephone sessions by a trained 
      therapist. Furthermore, these survivors will have access to a supportive website (or 
      workbook) throughout the therapy. Survivors in the control condition will not 
      receive the intervention and will not have access to the website. The primary 
      outcome will be severity of fear of recurrence (Cancer Worry Scale). Quality of life 
      (EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30) and general psychological wellbeing 
      will be assessed as secondary outcomes. Assessments will take place at baseline 
      (before random assignment), at 3, 9 and 15 months after the baseline assessment. The 
      study has been approved by an ethical review board. DISCUSSION: If the intervention 
      proves to be effective an evidence-based therapy to manage high FCR will become 
      available for use in clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing literature on panic disorder (PD) yields no data regarding the 
      differential rates of improvement during Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), 
      Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) or both combined (CBT+SSRI). METHOD: 
      Patients were randomized to CBT, SSRI or CBT+SSRI which each lasted one year 
      including three months of medication taper. Participating patients kept record of 
      the frequency of panic attacks throughout the full year of treatment. Rate of 
      improvement on panic frequency and the relationship between rate of improvement and 
      baseline agoraphobia (AG) were examined. RESULTS: A significant decline in frequency 
      of panic attacks was observed for each treatment modality. SSRI and CBT+SSRI were 
      associated with a significant faster rate of improvement as compared to CBT. Gains 
      were maintained after tapering medication. For patients with moderate or severe AG, 
      CBT+SSRI was associated with a more rapid improvement on panic frequency as compared 
      to patients receiving either mono-treatment. LIMITATIONS: Frequency of panic attacks 
      was not assessed beyond the full year of treatment. Second, only one process 
      variable was used. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PD respond well to each treatment as 
      indicated by a significant decline in panic attacks. CBT is associated with a slower 
      rate of improvement as compared to SSRI and CBT+SSRI. Discontinuation of SSRI 
      treatment does not result in a revival of frequency of panic attacks. Our data 
      suggest that for patients without or with only mild AG, SSRI-only will suffice. For 
      patients with moderate or severe AG, the combined CBT+SSRI treatment is recommended.

TI  - The relationships between symptoms and quality of life over the course of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder in Japan.
LID - 10.1111/appy.12249 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study examined the relationships between changes in symptoms and 
      changes in quality of life (QOL) during cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic 
      disorder (PD). METHODS: We treated 198 PD patients with group CBT in Japan. Using 
      multiple regression analysis, we examined the associations between changes in QOL 
      and changes in PD symptoms or comorbid psychological symptoms during CBT. RESULTS: 
      Changes in anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobic fear/avoidance, and somatization were 
      significant predictors of changes in some aspects of QOL. DISCUSSION: It might be 
      useful to decrease somatization, anticipatory anxiety, and agoraphobic fear to 
      improve QOL in CBT for PD.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment of social phobia: new advances.
PG  - 289-96
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for social phobia is an effective treatment for 
      many patients, but some patients do not benefit from the treatments and many remain 
      symptomatic. Therefore, researchers have been examining techniques that may improve 
      treatment outcome. In this paper, recent psychopathology and treatment outcome 
      research, much of which supports the expectation that a second-generation CBT 
      treatment may further improve outcome, are discussed. Finally, the authors present a 
      number of CBT techniques that are tailored for the individual treatment of patients 
      with social phobia. These methods, based on comprehensive CBT developed by Foa et 
      al. and on cognitive therapy for social phobia developed by Clark et al. include 
      developing an idiographic model for the patient, conducting safety behaviors 
      experiments, providing video feedback after cognitive preparation, developing a 
      hierarchy, conducting in vivo exposures and other behavioral experiments, imaginal 
      exposure, social skills training, assertiveness training, and behavioral activation 
      for depression.

      Treatment For Child Hood Anxiety Disorders].
PG  - 0
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of the Fear 
      Hunter cognitive behavioral therapy program, which was developed for the treatment 
      of childhood anxiety disorders, and to compare its effectiveness with standard 
      medication treatment. METHOD: A total of 46 participants (aged 8 to 12) that applied 
      to the Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry clinic 
      and had a diagnosis of anxiety disorder were recruited for the study. The 
      participants were randomly assigned to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), standard 
      drug treatment (ST), or combined treatment (CBT+ ST) groups according to the order 
      of application. Subjects were evaluated using pretest, posttest and 3 months 
      follow-up measurements. The participants were assessed by the researcher using The 
      Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), The Children's 
      Negative Cognitive Errors Questionnaire (CNCEQ), Health Related Quality of Life in 
      Children (Kid-KINDL), and Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). RESULTS: The 
      results of repeated measures ANOVA showed that, although general anxiety scores of 
      all treatment conditions significantly decreased at posttest and follow up, a 
      combination of two therapies (CBT+ST) had a significantly superior response rate. 
      Moreover, all treatment conditions including CBT (CBT+ST and CBT) were superior to 
      ST in terms of negative cognitive errors, quality of life, and depression. 
      CONCLUSION: It is thought that The Fear Hunter Therapy Program is an effective 
      treatment technique because; it provides significant improvement in the primary and 
      secondary symptoms (e.g. quality of life, depression, negative automatic thoughts) 
      of childhood anxiety disorders.

LID - 10.1002/jclp.22424 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the predictive value of cognitive coping strategies at 
      pretreatment and the value of changes in these strategies during 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment for aviophobia for long-term therapy results. METHOD: 
      Data from baseline, after therapy at 2 months, short-term follow-up at 5 months, and 
      long-term follow-up at 41 months were analyzed (N = 59). RESULTS: Participants were 
      in a long-term process of change, which continued positively after therapy for 
      maladaptive cognitive coping strategies. The use of cognitive coping strategies at 
      baseline was not predictive of long-term outcome. However, a greater increase in the 
      use of adaptive coping strategies, and more importantly, a greater decrease in the 
      use of maladaptive coping strategies were predictive of improvements indicated in 
      self-report of flight anxiety and actual flight behavior at long-term follow-up. 
      CONCLUSION: Improvement of maladaptive cognitive coping strategies is possibly a key 
      mechanism of change in cognitive-behavioral therapy for aviophobia.

LID - S0887-6185(18)30253-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.janxdis.2019.02.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
      many children and adolescents with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), therapeutic 
      response is variable. Fear conditioning and extinction are central constructs 
      underlying exposure-based CBT. Fear extinction learning assessed prior to CBT may be 
      a useful predictor of CBT response for guiding treatment decisions. METHODS: 
      Sixty-four youth who participated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of CBT 
      with and without d-cycloserine (DCS) completed a fear conditioning task. Skin 
      conductance response (SCR) scores were used to measure fear acquisition and 
      extinction to determine whether extinction learning could predict CBT response. 
      RESULTS: CBT responders and non-responders appeared to acquire conditioned fear SCRs 
      in a similar manner. However, differences between treatment responders and 
      non-responders emerged during the extinction phase. A responder (responder, 
      non-responder) by conditioned stimulus type (CS+, CS-) interaction showed that CBT 
      responders differentiated the stimulus paired with (CS+) and without (CS-) the 
      unconditioned stimulus correctly during early and late extinction, whereas the CBT 
      non-responders did not (p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: While the small sample size makes 
      conclusions tentative, this study supports an emerging literature that differential 
      fear extinction may be an important factor underlying clinical correlates of 
      pediatric OCD, including CBT response.

TI  - Can pill placebo augment cognitive-behavior therapy for panic disorder?
PG  - 73
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a number of drug and psychotherapy comparative trials, 
      psychotherapy-placebo combination has been assumed to represent psychotherapy. 
      Whether psychotherapy plus pill placebo is the same as psychotherapy alone is an 
      empirical question which however has to date never been examined systematically. 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) that directly compared cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) alone against 
      CBT plus pill placebo in the treatment of panic disorder. RESULTS: Extensive 
      literature search was able to identify three relevant RCTs. At the end of the acute 
      phase treatment, patients who received CBT plus placebo had 26% (95%CI: 2 to 55%) 
      increased chances of responding than those who received CBT alone. At follow-up the 
      difference was no longer statistically significant (22%, 95%CI: -10% to 64%). 
      CONCLUSION: The act of taking a pill placebo may enhance the placebo effect already 
      contained in the effective psychotherapeutic intervention during the acute phase 
      treatment. Theoretically this is an argument against the recently claimed null 
      hypothesis of placebo effect in general and clinically it may point to some further 
      room for enhancing the psychotherapeutic approach for panic disorder.

TI  - Benzodiazepine use, cognitive impairment, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for 
      anxiety disorders: issues in the treatment of a patient in need.
PG  - 34-8
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in the treatment of anxiety 
      disorders when used in conjunction with benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy and when used 
      as a monotherapy. Patients using CBT alone have dropout rates similar to or lower 
      than those patients undergoing other forms of therapy, including benzodiazepines. 
      CBT also works well with patients who do not respond adequately to pharmacotherapy. 
      Combined CBT and benzodiazepine treatment has additive effects when compared with 
      benzodiazepine monotherapy; however, patients receiving combined therapy who 
      subsequently discontinue benzodiazepine treatment experience a loss of efficacy 
      compared with CBT and placebo, perhaps due to fear extinction being context 
      dependent. To avoid this loss of efficacy, CBT may be administered alone or as a 
      bridge between benzodiazepine use and discontinuation during a medication taper. The 
      case report upon which this supplement is based questions the value of CBT for 
      patients experiencing cognitive impairment due to an anxiety disorder, 
      benzodiazepine medication, substance abuse, or a combination of these factors. This 
      article addresses this concern and asserts that CBT is a valuable treatment option 
      in these cases.

TI  - Bulimia nervosa.
LID - 1009 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Up to 1% of young women may have bulimia nervosa, characterised by an 
      intense preoccupation with body weight, uncontrolled binge-eating episodes, and use 
      of extreme measures to counteract the feared effects of overeating. People with 
      bulimia nervosa may be of normal weight, making it difficult to diagnose. After ten 
      years, about half of people with bulimia nervosa will have recovered fully, a third 
      will have made a partial recovery, and 10-20% will still have symptoms. METHODS AND 
      OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following 
      clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for bulimia nervosa in 
      adults? What are the effects of discontinuing treatment in people with bulimia 
      nervosa in remission? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other 
      important databases up to June 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated 
      periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this 
      review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food 
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products 
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 26 systematic reviews, RCTs, or 
      observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE 
      evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of 
      the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy (alone or plus exposure 
      response prevention enhancement); cognitive orientation therapy; dialectical 
      behavioural therapy; discontinuing fluoxetine in people with remission; guided 
      self-help cognitive behavioural therapy; hypnobehavioural therapy; interpersonal 
      psychotherapy; mirtazapine; monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); motivational 
      enhancement therapy; pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy; pure or unguided self-help 
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); reboxetine; selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs); topiramate; tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); and venlafaxine.

TI  - Preschool-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder with complete remission.
PG  - 1747-1753
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S169797 [doi]
AB  - Early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is more severe than later-onset OCD. 
      There are no reports of any early-onset OCD patients being cured, especially with 
      respect to preschoolers. In this case report, we describe the successful treatment 
      and cure of a 6-year-old preschool girl with severe OCD since the age of 3. At the 
      age of 3, the patient began to fear contamination and danger to herself and her 
      family, leading to excessive hand-washing, and several months later, ritualized 
      checking. The OCD symptoms waxed and waned for about 3 years and thereafter worsened 
      gradually over a few weeks, culminating in a refusal to eat and dress. At the age of 
      6, after a week of inpatient pediatric treatment with no improvement, the patient 
      was transferred to Osaka City University Hospital to seek psychiatric treatment. The 
      patient fully recovered from OCD following family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) and short-term use of low-dose fluvoxamine in an inpatient setting. After 
      treatment, the OCD symptoms disappeared with complete remission for over 3 years. 
      Now, aged 9, the patient has good global functioning and is well adjusted in her 
      daily life with no need for any treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
      first report of preschool-onset OCD with long-term complete remission with inpatient 
      treatment in a preschooler with severe OCD. Some preschoolers with very early-onset 
      OCD may have good prognosis without continuous pharmacotherapy, although the 
      symptoms with the onset are severe enough to require hospitalization. 
      Preschool-onset OCD is likely to be misdiagnosed as separation anxiety disorder. Our 
      findings suggest that family-based CBT, which is the treatment of choice for 
      preschool-onset OCD, can be applicable to inpatient treatment. Early detection and 
      intensive intervention of OCD in preschoolers may improve the chance of remission.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and 
      commitment therapy (ACT) have both garnered empirical support for the effective 
      treatment of social anxiety disorder. However, not every patient benefits equally 
      from either treatment. Identifying moderators of treatment outcome can help to 
      better understand which treatment is best suited for a particular patient. METHODS: 
      Forty-nine individuals who met criteria for social anxiety disorder were assessed as 
      part of a randomized controlled trial comparing 12 weeks of CBT and ACT. 
      Pre-treatment avoidance of social situations (measured via a public speaking task 
      and clinician rating) was investigated as a moderator of post-treatment, 6-month 
      follow-up, and 12-month follow-up social anxiety symptoms, stress reactivity, and 
      quality of life. RESULTS: Public speaking avoidance was found to be a robust 
      moderator of outcome measures, with more avoidant individuals generally benefitting 
      more from CBT than ACT by 12-month follow-up. In contrast, clinician-rated social 
      avoidance was not found to be a significant moderator of any outcome measure. 
      LIMITATIONS: Results were found only at 12-month follow-up. More comprehensive 
      measures of avoidance would be useful for the field moving forward. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Findings inform personalized medicine, suggesting that social avoidance measured 
      behaviorally via a public speaking task may be a more robust factor in treatment 
      prescription compared to clinician-rated social avoidance.

TI  - Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Nightmares for Patients with Persecutory Delusions 
      (Nites): An Assessor-Blind, Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 686-696
LID - 10.1177/0706743719847422 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nightmares are relatively common in patients experiencing psychosis but 
      rarely assessed or treated. Nightmares may maintain persecutory delusions by 
      portraying fears in sensory-rich detail. We tested the potential benefits of 
      imagery-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for nightmares on nightmare 
      severity and persecutory delusions. METHOD: This assessor-blind parallel-group pilot 
      trial randomized 24 participants with nightmares and persecutory delusions to 
      receive CBT for nightmares delivered over 4 weeks in addition to treatment as usual 
      (TAU) or TAU alone. Assessments were at 0, 4 (end of treatment), and 8 weeks 
      (follow-up). Feasibility outcomes assessed therapy uptake, techniques used, 
      satisfaction, and attrition. The primary efficacy outcome assessed nightmare 
      severity at week 4. Analyses were intention to treat, estimating treatment effect 
      with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: All participants offered CBT completed 
      therapy (mean [SD], 4.8 [0.6] sessions) with high satisfaction, and 20 (83%) 
      participants completed all assessments. Compared with TAU, CBT led to large 
      improvements in nightmares (adjusted mean difference = -7.0; 95% CI, -12.6 to -1.3; 
      d = -1.1) and insomnia (6.3; 95% CI, 2.6 to 10.0; d = 1.4) at week 4. Gains were 
      maintained at follow-up. Suicidal ideation was not exacerbated by CBT but remained 
      stable to follow-up, compared with TAU, which reduced at follow-up (6.8; 95% CI, 0.3 
      to 3.3; d = 0.7). CBT led to reductions in paranoia (-20.8; 95% CI, -43.2 to 1.7; d 
      = -0.6), although CIs were wide. Three serious adverse events were deemed unrelated 
      to participation (CBT = 2, TAU = 1). CONCLUSIONS: CBT for nightmares is feasible and 
      may be efficacious for treating nightmares and comorbid insomnia for patients with 
      persecutory delusions. It shows promise on paranoia but potentially not on suicidal 
      ideation.

TI  - A pragmatic randomized controlled trial of group transdiagnostic cognitive-behaviour 
      therapy for anxiety disorders in primary care: study protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in community 
      settings, and they are associated with significant psychological distress, 
      functional and social impairment. While cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the 
      most consistently efficacious psychological treatment for anxiety disorders, 
      barriers preclude widespread implementation of CBT in primary care. Transdiagnostic 
      group CBT (tCBT) focuses on cognitive and behavioural processes and intervention 
      strategies common to different anxiety disorders, and could be a promising 
      alternative to conventional CBT. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a 
      transdiagnostic group CBT for anxiety disorders program as a complement to 
      treatment-as-usual (TAU) in primary mental health care. METHODS/DESIGN: The trial is 
      a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a pre-treatment, 
      post-treatment, and follow-up at 4, 8 and 12-months design. Treatment and control 
      groups. a) tCBT (12 weekly 2-h group sessions following a manualized treatment 
      protocol); b) TAU for anxiety disorders. Inclusion criteria comprise meeting DSM-5 
      criteria for primary Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder and/or 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Patients are recruited in three regions in the 
      province of Quebec, Canada. The primary outcome measures are the self-reported Beck 
      Anxiety Inventory and the clinician-administered Anxiety and Related Disorders 
      Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5); secondary outcome measures include treatment 
      responder status based on the ADIS-5, and self-reported instruments for specific 
      anxiety and depression symptoms, quality of life, functioning, and service 
      utilisation. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Intention-to-treat analysis. A mixed effects 
      regression model will be used to account for between- and within-subject variations 
      in the analysis of the longitudinal effects of the intervention. DISCUSSION: This 
      rigorous evaluation of tCBT in the real world will provide invaluable information to 
      decision makers, health care managers, clinicians and patients regarding the 
      effectiveness of the intervention. Widespread implementation of tCBT protocols in 
      primary care could lead to better effectiveness, efficiency, access and equity for 
      the large number of patients suffering from anxiety disorders that are currently not 
      obtaining evidence-based psychotherapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov:

TI  - The change of regional brain metabolism (18FDG PET) in panic disorder during the 
      treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants.
PG  - 340-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of our study was to identify brain structures in patients with 
      panic disorder (PD) that show changes in 18FDG PET during the treatment with 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or antidepressants. METHOD: Twelve patients 
      suffering from panic disorder were studied with [18F]-2-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron 
      emission tomography (18FDG PET) scanning during resting state (condition of random 
      episodic silent thinking, REST). After PET examination patients were randomly 
      assigned to either cognitive behavioral treatment group (6 patients) or 
      antidepressants treatment group (6 patients). After a 3 month period 18FDG PET 
      examination was repeated in both groups. Psychopathology was assessed using the 
      rating scales HAMA, CGI and Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). Data were analysed 
      using software for statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). RESULTS: The scores of 
      psychopathology rating scales (CGI, HAMA, PDSS) decreased in both groups. Changes of 
      18FDG uptake in the pharmacotherapy group: decreases were found in the a priori 
      hypothesized regions in the right hemisphere, in the superior, middle, medial and 
      inferior frontal gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and increases were 
      detected in the a priori hypothesized regions, mainly in the left hemisphere in 
      medial and middle frontal gyrus, superior, middle and transverse temporal gyrus. 
      Changes of 18FDG uptake in the CBT group: decreases were found in the a priori 
      hypothesized regions of the right hemisphere in the inferior temporal gyrus, 
      superior and inferior frontal gyrus, and increases were detected in the a priori 
      hypothesized region, mostly in the left hemisphere: inferior frontal gyrus, middle 
      temporal gyrus and insula. We did not detect changes in 18FDG uptake in the limbic 
      region (hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in 
      brain metabolism (18FDG uptake) after the treatment either with CBT or with 
      antidepressants were similar in number of brain areas, with prominent right-left 
      difference. This is in concordance with the asymmetry of brain activity noted in 
      patients with PD according to previous PET (and SPECT) studies.

TI  - Predicting treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy in panic disorder with 
      agoraphobia by integrating local neural information.
PG  - 68-74
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.1741 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Although neuroimaging research has made substantial progress in 
      identifying the large-scale neural substrate of anxiety disorders, its value for 
      clinical application lags behind expectations. Machine-learning approaches have 
      predictive potential for individual-patient prognostic purposes and might thus aid 
      translational efforts in psychiatric research. OBJECTIVE: To predict treatment 
      response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on an individual-patient level based 
      on functional magnetic resonance imaging data in patients with panic disorder with 
      agoraphobia (PD/AG). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 49 patients free 
      of medication for at least 4 weeks and with a primary diagnosis of PD/AG in a 
      longitudinal study performed at 8 clinical research institutes and outpatient 
      centers across Germany. The functional magnetic resonance imaging study was 
      conducted between July 2007 and March 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve CBT sessions 
      conducted 2 times a week focusing on behavioral exposure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Treatment response was defined as exceeding a 50% reduction in Hamilton 
      Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Blood oxygenation level-dependent signal was measured 
      during a differential fear-conditioning task. Regional and whole-brain gaussian 
      process classifiers using a nested leave-one-out cross-validation were used to 
      predict the treatment response from data acquired before CBT. RESULTS: Although no 
      single brain region was predictive of treatment response, integrating regional 
      classifiers based on data from the acquisition and the extinction phases of the 
      fear-conditioning task for the whole brain yielded good predictive performance 
      (accuracy, 82%; sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 72%; P < .001). Data from the 
      acquisition phase enabled 73% correct individual-patient classifications 
      (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 67%; P < .001), whereas data from the extinction 
      phase led to an accuracy of 74% (sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 83%; P < .001). 
      Conservative reanalyses under consideration of potential confounders yielded 
      nominally lower but comparable accuracy rates (acquisition phase, 70%; extinction 
      phase, 71%; combined, 79%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Predicting treatment response 
      to CBT based on functional neuroimaging data in PD/AG is possible with high accuracy 
      on an individual-patient level. This novel machine-learning approach brings 
      personalized medicine within reach, directly supporting clinical decisions for the 
      selection of treatment options, thus helping to improve response rates.

TI  - Common Questions About Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Psychiatric Disorders.
PG  - 807-12
AB  - Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a time-limited, goal-oriented psychotherapy that 
      has been extensively researched and has benefits in a number of psychiatric 
      disorders, including anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive-compulsive and tic 
      disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, and insomnia. CBT uses targeted 
      strategies to help patients adopt more adaptive patterns of thinking and behaving, 
      which leads to positive changes in emotions and decreased functional impairments. 
      Strategies include identifying and challenging problematic thoughts and beliefs, 
      scheduling pleasant activities to increase environmental reinforcement, and extended 
      exposure to unpleasant thoughts, situations, or physiologic sensations to decrease 
      avoidance and arousal associated with anxiety-eliciting stimuli. CBT can be helpful 
      in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder by emphasizing safety, trust, 
      control, esteem, and intimacy. Prolonged exposure therapy is a CBT technique that 
      includes a variety of strategies, such as repeated recounting of the trauma and 
      exposure to feared real-world situations. For attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder, CBT focuses on establishing structures and routines, and clear rules and 
      expectations within the home and classroom. Early intensive behavioral interventions 
      should be initiated in children with autism before three years of age; therapy 
      consists of 12 to 40 hours of intensive treatment per week, for at least one year. 
      In many disorders, CBT can be used alone or in combination with medications. 
      However, CBT requires a significant commitment from patients. Family physicians are 
      well suited to provide collaborative care for patients with psychiatric disorders, 
      in concert with cognitive behavior therapists.

TI  - Differential effects of alliance and techniques on Panic-Specific Reflective 
      Function and misinterpretation of bodily sensations in two treatments for panic.
PG  - 97-111
LID - 10.1080/10503307.2019.1585591 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACTObjective: To examine whether working alliance quality and use of techniques 
      predict improvement in Panic-Specific Reflection Function (PSRF), and 
      misinterpretation of bodily sensations in treatments for panic disorder. Method: A 
      sample of 161 patients received either CBT or PFPP (Panic-focused Psychodynamic 
      therapy) within a larger RCT. Data were collected on patient-reported working 
      alliance, misinterpretations, PSRF, observer-coded use of techniques, and 
      interviewer-rated panic severity. Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models 
      assessed bi-directional associations, disentangling within- and between-patient 
      effects, and accounting for prior change. Results: Higher alliance predicted 
      subsequent within-patient improvement in PSRF in PFPP, but worsening in CBT. In both 
      treatments, focus on interpersonal relationships predicted PRSF improvement (with 
      stronger effects in CBT), while focus on thoughts and behaviors predicted worsening 
      in PSRF. In CBT only, early focus on affect and moment-to-moment experience 
      predicted reduced misinterpretation, while high focus on thoughts and cognitions 
      predicted subsequent increase in misinterpretation. Conclusion: The quality of the 
      alliance has differential effects on PSRF in distinct treatments. Interpersonal, 
      rather than cognitive or behavioral focus, even when delivered differently within 
      distinct treatments with high adherence, could facilitate improvement in PSRF. 
      Additionally, early focus on affect and moment-to-moment experiences in CBT could 
      reduce misinterpretations.

TI  - Efficacy of the Unified Protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of comorbid 
      psychopathology accompanying emotional disorders compared to treatments targeting 
      single disorders.

LID - S0022-3956(18)30476-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.08.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether the Unified Protocol (UP), a 
      transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy for emotional disorders (i.e., anxiety, 
      mood, and related disorders), is efficacious in the treatment of co-occurring 
      emotional disorders compared to established single disorder protocols (SDPs) that 
      target specific disorders (e.g., panic disorder). METHOD: Participants included 179 
      adults seeking outpatient psychotherapy. Participant age ranged from 18 to 66 years, 
      with an average of 30.66 years (SD = 10.77). The sample was 55% female and mostly 
      Caucasian (83%). Diagnostic assessments were completed with the Anxiety Disorder 
      Interview Schedule (ADIS), and disorder-specific, clinician-rated measures for the 
      comorbid diagnoses of interest. RESULTS: In both treatment conditions, participants' 
      mean number of diagnoses dropped significantly from baseline to posttreatment, and 
      baseline to 12-month follow-up. Additionally, large effects were observed for 
      changes in comorbid generalized anxiety (ES(SG): UP = -1.72; SDP = -1.98), social 
      anxiety (ES(SG): UP = -1.33, -0.86; SDP = -1.60, -1.54), and depression (ES(SG): 
      UP = -0.83; SDP = -0.84). Significant differences were not observed in between-group 
      comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that both the UP and SDPs are efficacious 
      in reducing symptoms of comorbid emotional disorders. The clinical, practical, and 
      cost-effective advantages of transdiagnostic CBT are discussed.

TI  - Assessment and treatment of social phobia.
PG  - 826-34
AB  - Social phobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by heightened fear and avoidance 
      of one or more social or performance situations, including public speaking, meeting 
      new people, eating or writing in front of others, and attending social gatherings. 
      People with social phobia are typically anxious about the possibility that others 
      will evaluate them negatively and/or notice symptoms of their anxiety. Social phobia 
      affects up to 13% of individuals at some time in their lives and is usually 
      associated with at least moderate functional impairment. Research on the nature and 
      treatment of social phobia has increased dramatically over the past decade. As with 
      many of the anxiety disorders, sensitive assessment instruments and effective 
      treatments now exist for people suffering from heightened social anxiety. Typical 
      assessment strategies include clinical interviews, behavioural assessments, 
      monitoring diaries, and self-report questionnaires. Treatments with demonstrated 
      efficacy for social phobia include pharmacotherapy (for example, phenelzine, 
      moclobemide, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medications) and 
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (for example, cognitive restructuring, in vivo 
      exposure, social skills training). Although preliminary comparative studies suggest 
      that both approaches are about equally effective in the short term, each approach 
      has advantages and disadvantages over the other. Trials examining combined 
      psychological and pharmacological treatments are now under way, although no 
      published data on the relative efficacy of combined treatments are currently 
      available.

TI  - Neural substrates of treatment response to cognitive-behavioral therapy in panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia.
PG  - 1345-55
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12111484 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an 
      effective treatment option for panic disorder with agoraphobia, the neural 
      substrates of treatment response remain unknown. Evidence suggests that panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia is characterized by dysfunctional safety signal 
      processing. Using fear conditioning as a neurofunctional probe, the authors 
      investigated neural baseline characteristics and neuroplastic changes after CBT that 
      were associated with treatment outcome in patients with panic disorder with 
      agoraphobia. METHOD: Neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction were 
      measured using functional MRI before and after a manualized CBT program focusing on 
      behavioral exposure in 49 medication-free patients with a primary diagnosis of panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia. Treatment response was defined as a reduction exceeding 
      50% in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. RESULTS: At baseline, nonresponders 
      exhibited enhanced activation in the right pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, the 
      hippocampus, and the amygdala in response to a safety signal. While this activation 
      pattern partly resolved in nonresponders after CBT, successful treatment was 
      characterized by increased right hippocampal activation when processing stimulus 
      contingencies. Treatment response was associated with an inhibitory functional 
      coupling between the anterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala that did not change 
      over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified brain activation patterns associated 
      with treatment response in patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia. Altered 
      safety signal processing and anterior cingulate cortex-amygdala coupling may 
      indicate individual differences among these patients that determine the 
      effectiveness of exposure-based CBT and associated neuroplastic changes. Findings

TI  - A feasibility study of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
      individual cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder in a Japanese clinical 
      setting: an uncontrolled pilot study.
PG  - 458
LID - 458
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Japan, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder (PD) is 
      not well established. Therefore, a feasibility study of the clinical effectiveness 
      and cost-effectiveness of CBT for PD in a Japanese clinical setting is urgently 
      required. This was a pilot uncontrolled trial and the intervention consisted of a 
      16-week CBT program. The primary outcome was Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) 
      scores. Quality of life was assessed using the EuroQol's EQ-5D questionnaire. 
      Assessments were conducted at baseline, 8 weeks, and at the end of the study. 
      Fifteen subjects completed outcome measures at all assessment points. RESULTS: At 
      post-CBT, the mean reduction in PDSS scores from baseline was -6.6 (95 % CI 3.80 to 
      -9.40, p < 0.001) with a Cohen's d = 1.77 (95 % CI 0.88-2.55). Ten (66.7 %) 
      participants achieved a 40 % or greater reduction in PDSS. By calculating areas 
      under the curve for EQ-5D index changes, we estimated that patients gained a minimum 
      of 0.102 QALYs per 1 year due to the CBT. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 
      individual CBT for PD may be useful in Japanese clinical settings but further 
      randomized control trials are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN-CTR UMIN000022693 
      (retrospectively registered).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Correct prediction of treatment response is a central goal of precision 
      psychiatry. Here, we tested the predictive accuracy of a variety of pre-treatment 
      patient characteristics, including clinical, demographic, molecular genetic, and 
      neuroimaging markers, for treatment response in patients with social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD). METHODS: Forty-seven SAD patients (mean±SD age 33.9 ± 9.4 years, 24 
      women) were randomized and commenced 9 weeks' Internet-delivered cognitive behavior 
      therapy (CBT) combined either with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
      escitalopram (20 mg daily [10 mg first week], SSRI+CBT, n = 24) or placebo 
      (placebo+CBT, n = 23). Treatment responders were defined from the Clinical Global 
      Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I ≤ 2). Before treatment, patients underwent 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Multi-Source Interference Task taxing 
      cognitive interference. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained to separate 
      responders from nonresponders based on pre-treatment neural reactivity in the dorsal 
      anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), amygdala, and occipital cortex, as well as 
      molecular genetic, demographic, and clinical data. SVM models were tested using 
      leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The best model separated treatment 
      responders (n = 24) from nonresponders based on pre-treatment dACC reactivity (83% 
      accuracy, P = 0.001). Responders had greater pre-treatment dACC reactivity than 
      nonresponders especially in the SSRI+CBT group. No other variable was associated 
      with clinical response or added predictive accuracy to the dACC SVM model. 
      LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, especially for genetic analyses. No replication or 
      validation samples were available. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that 
      treatment outcome predictions based on neural cingulate activity, at the individual 
      level, outperform genetic, demographic, and clinical variables for 
      medication-assisted Internet-delivered CBT, supporting the use of neuroimaging in 
      precision psychiatry.

TI  - Study protocol of the CORRECT multicenter trial: the efficacy of blended cognitive 
      behavioral therapy for reducing psychological distress in colorectal cancer 
      survivors.
PG  - 748
LID - 10.1186/s12885-018-4645-6 [doi]
LID - 748
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately one third of the colorectal cancer survivors (CRCS) 
      experience high levels of psychological distress. Common concerns experienced by 
      CRCS include distress related to physical problems, anxiety, fear of cancer 
      recurrence (FCR) and depressive symptoms. However, psychological interventions for 
      distressed CRCS are scarce. Therefore, a blended therapy was developed, combining 
      face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with online self-management 
      activities and telephone consultations. The aim of the study is to evaluate the 
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this blended therapy in reducing psychological 
      distress in CRCS. METHODS/DESIGN: The CORRECT study is a two-arm multicenter 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). A sample of 160 highly distressed CRCS (a score 
      on the Distress Thermometer of 5 or higher) will be recruited from several hospitals 
      in the Netherlands. CRCS will be randomized to either the intervention condition 
      (blended CBT) or the control condition (care as usual). The blended therapy covers 
      approximately 14 weeks and combines five face-to-face sessions and three telephone 
      consultations with a psychologist, with access to an interactive self-management 
      website. It includes three modules which are individually-tailored to patient 
      concerns and aimed at decreasing: 1) distress caused by physical consequences of 
      CRC, 2) anxiety and FCR, 3) depressive symptoms. Patients can choose between the 
      optional modules. The primary outcome is general distress (Brief Symptom 
      Inventory-18). Secondary outcomes are quality of life and general psychological 
      wellbeing. Assessments will take place at baseline prior to randomization, after 4 
      and 7 months. DISCUSSION: Blended CBT is an innovative and promising approach for 
      providing tailored supportive care to reduce high distress in CRCS. If the 
      intervention proves to be effective, an evidence-based intervention will become 
      available for implementation in clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is 
      registered in the Netherlands Trial Register ( NTR6025 ) on August 3, 2016.

LID - 10.1186/s13063-016-1491-1 [doi]
LID - 352
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with recurrent episodes of non-cardiac chest pain may 
      experience cardiac anxiety and avoidance behavior, leading to increased healthcare 
      utilization. These patients might benefit from help and support to evaluate the 
      perception and management of their chest pain. The purpose of this study was to test 
      the feasibility of a short guided Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy 
      (CBT) program and explore the effects on cardiac anxiety, fear of body sensations, 
      depressive symptoms, and chest pain in patients with non-cardiac chest pain, 
      compared with usual care. METHODS: A pilot randomized controlled study was 
      conducted. Fifteen patients with non-cardiac chest pain with cardiac anxiety or fear 
      of body sensations, aged 22-76 years, were randomized to intervention (n = 7) or 
      control (n = 8) groups. The four-session CBT program contained psychoeducation, 
      physical activity, and relaxation. The control group received usual care. Data were 
      collected before and after intervention. RESULTS: Five of seven patients in the 
      intervention group completed the program, which was perceived as user-friendly with 
      comprehensible language, adequate and varied content, and manageable homework 
      assignments. Being guided and supported, patients were empowered and motivated to be 
      active and complete the program. Patients in both intervention and control groups 
      improved with regard to cardiac anxiety, fear of body sensations, and depressive 
      symptoms, but no significant differences were found between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The Internet-delivered CBT program seems feasible for patients with non-cardiac 
      chest pain, but needs to be evaluated in larger groups and with a longer follow-up 
      period. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02336880 . Registered on 8 January

TI  - Group cognitive behavior therapy for children with high-functioning autism spectrum 
      disorders and anxiety: a randomized trial.
PG  - 410-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are at 
      high risk for developing significant anxiety. Anxiety can adversely impact 
      functioning across school, home and community environments. Cognitive behavioral 
      therapies (CBT) are frequently used with success for children with anxiety symptoms. 
      Modified CBT interventions for anxiety in children with ASD have also yielded 
      promising results. METHODS: Fifty children with high-functioning ASD and anxiety 
      were randomizedto group CBT or treatment-as-usual (TAU) for 12 weeks. Independent 
      clinical evaluators, blind to condition, completed structured interviews (Anxiety 
      Disorders Interview Schedule – Parent Version;ADIS-P) pre- and post-intervention 
      condition. RESULTS: Forty-seven children completed either the CBT or TAU condition. 
      Results indicated markedly better outcomes for the CBT group. Significant 
      differences by group were noted in Clinician Severity Ratings, diagnostic status, 
      and clinician ratings of global improvement. In the intent-to-treat sample, 10 of 20 
      children (50%) in the CBT group had a clinically meaningful positive treatment 
      response, compared to 2 of 23 children (8.7%) in the TAU group. CONCLUSIONS: Initial 
      results from this randomized, designed treatment study suggest that agroup CBT 
      intervention specifically developed for children with ASD may be effective in 
      decreasing anxiety. Limitations of this study include small sample size, lack of an 
      attention control group, and use of outcome measures normed with typically 
      developing children

TI  - Does d-cycloserine facilitate the effects of homework compliance on social anxiety 
      symptom reduction?

LID - S0887-6185(17)30361-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.janxdis.2017.11.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies examining the effect of d-cycloserine (DCS) on homework 
      compliance and outcome in cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) have yielded mixed 
      results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DCS facilitates the 
      effects of homework compliance on symptom reduction in a large-scale study for 
      social anxiety disorder (SAD). METHODS: 169 participants with generalized SAD 
      received DCS or pill placebo during 12-session exposure-based group CBT. 
      Improvements in social anxiety were assessed by independent raters at each session 
      using the Liebowitz social anxiety scale (LSAS). RESULTS: Controlling for LSAS at 
      the previous session, and irrespective of treatment condition, greater homework 
      compliance in the week prior related to lower LSAS at the next session. However, DCS 
      did not moderate the effect of homework compliance and LSAS, LSAS on homework 
      compliance, or the overall augmenting effect of DCS on homework compliance. 
      Furthermore, LSAS levels were not predictive of homework compliance in the following 
      week. CONCLUSION: The findings support the general benefits of homework compliance 
      on outcome, but not a DCS-augmenting effect. The comparably small number of 
      DCS-enhanced sessions in this study could be one reason for the failure to find a 
      facilitating effect of DCS.

TI  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Normalizes Functional Connectivity for Social Threat in 
      Psychosis.
PG  - 684-92
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbv153 [doi]
AB  - Psychosis is often characterized by paranoia and poor social functioning. Neurally, 
      there is evidence of functional dysconnectivity including abnormalities when 
      processing facial affect. We sought to establish whether these abnormalities are 
      resolved by cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp). The study involved 38 
      outpatients with one or more persistent positive psychotic symptoms, and 20 healthy 
      participants. All participants completed an implicit facial affect processing task 
      during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subsequently, patients either 
      continued to receive standard care only (SCO,n= 16) or received CBTp on top of 
      standard care (+CBTp,n= 22), with fMRI repeated 6-8 months later. To examine the 
      mechanisms underlying CBTp-led changes in threat processing and appraisal, 
      functional connectivity during the social threat (angry faces) condition was 
      assessed separately from left amygdala and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC) seeds. At baseline, patients, compared with healthy participants, showed 
      greater amygdala connectivity with the insula and visual areas, but less 
      connectivity with somatosensory areas. These differences normalized following CBTp 
      and, compared with the SCO group, the +CBTp group showed greater increases in 
      amygdala connectivity with DLPFC and inferior parietal lobule, with the latter 
      correlating with improvement in positive symptoms. From the DLPFC seed, the +CBTp 
      (compared with SCO) group showed significantly greater increase in DLPFC 
      connectivity with other prefrontal regions including dorsal anterior cingulate and 
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate that CBTp strengthens 
      connectivity between higher-order cognitive systems and those involved in threat and 
      salience, potentially facilitating reappraisal.

TI  - Mental imagery as an emotional amplifier: application to bipolar disorder.
PG  - 1251-8
LID - 10.1016/j.brat.2008.09.005 [doi]
AB  - Cognitions in the form of mental images have a more powerful impact on emotion than 
      their verbal counterparts. This review synthesizes the cognitive science of imagery 
      and emotion with transdiagnostic clinical research, yielding novel predictions for 
      the basis of emotional volatility in bipolar disorder. Anxiety is extremely common 
      in patients with bipolar disorder and is associated with increased dysfunction and 
      suicidality, yet it is poorly understood and rarely treated. Mental imagery is a 
      neglected aspect of bipolar anxiety although in anxiety disorders such as 
      posttraumatic stress disorder and social phobia focusing on imagery has been crucial 
      for the development of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). In this review we present a 
      cognitive model of imagery and emotion applied to bipolar disorder. Within this 
      model mental imagery amplifies emotion, drawing on Clark's cyclical panic model 
      [(1986). A cognitive approach to panic. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 24, 
      461-470]. We (1) emphasise imagery's amplification of anxiety (cycle one); (2) 
      suggest that imagery amplifies the defining (hypo-) mania of bipolar disorder (cycle 
      two), whereby the overly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to mood 
      elevation (escalated by imagery), increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action 
      likelihood (all strengthened by imagery). Imagery suggests a unifying explanation 
      for key unexplained features of bipolar disorder: ubiquitous anxiety, mood 
      instability and creativity. Introducing imagery has novel implications for bipolar 
      treatment innovation--an area where CBT improvements are much-needed.

TI  - Assessment and management of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
PG  - 674-8
AB  - Anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence are extremely common and are often 
      associated with lifelong psychiatric disturbance. Consistent with DSM-5 and the 
      extant literature, this review concerns the assessment and treatment of specific 
      phobias, separation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety 
      disorder, panic disorder and agoraphobia. Evidence-based psychological treatments 
      (cognitive behaviour therapy; CBT) for these disorders have been developed and 
      investigated, and in recent years promising low-intensity versions of CBT 
      interventions have been proposed that offer a means to increase access to 
      evidence-based treatments. There is some evidence of effectiveness of 
      pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people, 
      however, routine prescription is not recommended due to concerns about potential 
      harm.

AB  - Current data point to an alteration of both the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA)-system and the peripheral transmission of catecholamines in anxiety disorders. 
      There is also some evidence for the effect of several components of 
      cognitive-behavioural interventions such as coping and control and for an effect of 
      exercise training on the neuroendocrine stress response in healthy subjects as well 
      as patients suffering from distinct (mental) disorders. This double-blind, 
      controlled study investigated the effect of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in 
      combination with either high-level endurance training or low-level exercise on 
      salivary cortisol (sC) and on levels of salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) in patients 
      suffering from panic disorder (PD) with and without agoraphobia. In comparison to 
      the low-level exercise condition, there were significantly lower sC-levels in the 
      experimental group performing high-level endurance training at a 7-month follow-up. 
      In contrast, there were no group differences in sAA levels during the study period. 
      In this trial, we found evidence for a decelerated effect of endurance-training on 
      HPA-system's functioning in PD. Further studies addressing the alteration of sAA 
      levels in this population might investigate physical exercise different in intensity 
      and duration.

TI  - Bulimia nervosa.
LID - 1009 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Up to 1% of young women may have bulimia nervosa, characterised by an 
      intense preoccupation with body weight, uncontrolled binge-eating episodes, and use 
      of extreme measures to counteract the feared effects of overeating. People with 
      bulimia nervosa may be of normal weight, making it difficult to diagnose. After 10 
      years, about half of people with bulimia nervosa will have recovered fully, one 
      third will have made a partial recovery, and 10% to 20% will still have symptoms. 
      METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the 
      following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for bulimia nervosa 
      in adults? What are the effects of discontinuing treatment in people with bulimia 
      nervosa in remission? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other 
      important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated 
      periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this 
      review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food 
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products 
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 27 systematic reviews, RCTs, or 
      observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE 
      evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of 
      the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; alone or plus 
      exposure/response prevention enhancement), cognitive orientation therapy, 
      dialectical behavioural therapy, discontinuing fluoxetine in people with remission, 
      guided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy, hypnobehavioural therapy, 
      interpersonal psychotherapy, mirtazapine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), 
      motivational enhancement therapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pure or 
      unguided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy, reboxetine, selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), topiramate, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and 
      venlafaxine.

AB  - Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS-I) impacts on fear/anxiety-like behavior in 
      animals. In humans, the short (S) allele of a functional promotor polymorphism of 
      NOS1 (NOS1 ex1f-VNTR) has been shown to be associated with higher anxiety and 
      altered fear conditioning in healthy subjects in the amygdala and hippocampus 
      (AMY/HIPP). Here, we explore the role of NOS1 ex1f-VNTR as a pathophysiological 
      correlate of panic disorder and agoraphobia (PD/AG). In a sub-sample of a 
      multicenter cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) randomized controlled trial in 
      patients with PD/AG (n = 48: S/S-genotype n=15, S/L-genotype n=21, L/L-genotype 
      n=12) and healthy control subjects, HS (n = 34: S/S-genotype n=7, S/L-genotype n=17, 
      L/L-genotype=10), a differential fear conditioning and extinction fMRI-paradigm was 
      used to investigate how NOS1 ex1f-VNTR genotypes are associated with differential 
      neural activation in AMY/HIPP. Prior to CBT, L/L-allele carriers showed higher 
      activation than S/S-allele carriers in AMY/HIPP. A genotype × diagnosis interaction 
      revealed that the S-allele in HS was associated with a pronounced deactivation in 
      AMY/HIPP, while patients showed contrary effects. The interaction of genotype × 
      stimulus type (CS+, conditioned stimulus associated with an aversive stimulus vs. 
      CS-, unassociated) showed effects on differential learning in AMY/HIPP. All effects 
      were predominately found during extinction. Genotype associated effects in patients 
      were not altered after CBT. Low statistical power due to small sample size in each 
      subgroup is a major limitation. However, our findings provide first preliminary 
      evidence for dysfunctional neural fear conditioning/extinction associated with NOS1 
      ex1f-VNTR genotype in the context of PD/AG, shedding new light on the complex 
      interaction between genetic risk, current psychopathology and treatment-related 
      effects.

AB  - Relapse is a pertinent problem in the treatment of anxiety disorders. In the 
      laboratory, relapse is modeled as return of conditioned fear responses after 
      successful fear extinction and is explained by insufficient retrieval and/or 
      expression of the fear-inhibitory extinction memory that is generated during 
      extinction learning. We have shown in mice and humans that return of fear can be 
      prevented by administration of a single dose of the dopamine precursor 
      l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) immediately after extinction. In mice, this 
      effect could be attributed to an enhancement of extinction memory consolidation. In 
      our human study, we could not exclude that l-DOPA might have acted by interfering 
      with the consolidation of the original fear memory. In the present study, we 
      therefore used a combined differential cue and context conditioning paradigm where 
      initial fear conditioning and extinction were conducted one day apart, in analogy to 
      previous mouse studies. l-DOPA (N=21) or placebo (N=19) were administered after 
      extinction, precluding any action on fear memory consolidation. In the 
      return-of-fear test conducted one week later, drug effects on conditioned skin 
      conductance responses were absent. However, we found evidence indicative of reduced 
      neural activity, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the 
      l-DOPA group in areas related to conditioned fear and return of fear (amygdala, 
      posterior hippocampus) and enhanced activity in a key area of extinction 
      retrieval/expression (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), relative to placebo controls. 
      These findings require further corroboration in additional experiments. Implications 
      for further investigations on the role of the dopamine system in extinction and on 
      the neuropharmacological augmentation of extinction-based therapies are discussed.

      characteristics and treatment response to cognitive behaviour therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Transformation obsessions denote an under-reported 
      symptom of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), characterised by an excessive fear 
      of turning into another person/object or acquiring unwanted characteristics. 
      Relative to other OCD symptoms, little is known about the clinical presentation of 
      transformation obsessions. The study aims to examine the clinical correlates and 
      treatment prognosis of transformation obsessions in a paediatric OCD sample. 
      METHODS: The sample consisted of 346 youths with a primary diagnosis of OCD. 
      Patients with and without transformation obsessions were compared in terms of 
      demographic and clinical characteristics, and CBT outcomes. RESULTS: 10% of the 
      sample endorsed transformation obsessions. Patients with transformation obsessions 
      were more likely to be boys, to be on augmented medication regimes, and to present 
      with more severe obsessions at assessment. A factor analysis identified four major 
      OCD symptom clusters, with transformation obsessions loading on a 'forbidden 
      thoughts' factor alongside aggressive, sexual, and religious obsessions. No group 
      differences in treatment outcomes were observed. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include 
      the cross-sectional and retrospective nature of the study, the representativeness of 
      our sample, and use of concomitant medication, among others. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      provides the first empirical evidence regarding phenomenological similarities and 
      differences between paediatric OCD patients presenting with and without 
      transformation obsessions. The findings suggest that transformation obsessions are 
      best conceptualised as related to 'forbidden' obsessions and respond to 
      exposure-based CBT.

TI  - Pain catastrophizing, activity engagement and pain willingness as predictors of the 
      benefits of multidisciplinary cognitive behaviorally-based chronic pain treatment.

AB  - Pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance have been shown to be associated with 
      improvements after participation in cognitive behaviorally-based treatment (CBT) for 
      chronic pain. However, it is not yet clear how important each of these factors is 
      relative to the other. Furthermore, it is also not clear if multidisciplinary pain 
      treatment has the same impact on the two primary dimensions of pain acceptance 
      (activity engagement and pain willingness), and whether their role in explaining 
      treatment outcome differs as a function of the outcomes under study. The aim of this 
      study was to examine the relative importance of changes in pain catastrophizing, 
      activity engagement and pain willingness as predictors of the benefits of a 
      multidisciplinary CBT for chronic pain. 186 adults with chronic pain participated. 
      Pain catastrophizing and activity engagement, but not pain willingness, were 
      significantly associated with treatment outcome. Moreover, each one evidenced 
      different patterns of associations with outcomes. Specifically, while changes in 
      both were associated with improvements in depressive symptoms, only catastrophizing 
      was associated with improvements in pain intensity and only activity engagement was 
      associated with improvements in pain-related disability.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by aberrant prefrontal activity 
      during reappraisal, an adaptive cognitive approach aimed at downregulating the 
      automatic response evoked by a negative event. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is 
      first-line psychotherapy for SAD, however, many remain symptomatic after treatment 
      indicating baseline individual differences in neurofunctional activity may factor 
      into CBT outcome. An emotion regulation strategy practiced in CBT is cognitive 
      restructuring, a proxy for reappraisal. Therefore, neural response during 
      reappraisal may serve as a brain-based predictor of CBT success. Prior to 12weeks of 
      individual CBT, 34 patients with SAD completed a validated emotion regulation task 
      during fMRI. Task instructions included 'Reappraise,' that is, use a cognitive 
      approach to reduce affective state to a negative image, which was contrasted with 
      looking at a negative image ('Look'). Regression results for Reappraise (vs. Look) 
      revealed greater reduction in symptom severity was predicted by less pre-CBT 
      activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Regarding predictive 
      validity, DLPFC significantly classified responder status. Post-hoc analysis 
      revealed DLPFC activity, but not demographic data, baseline clinical measures, or 
      reappraisal-related affective state during fMRI, significantly accounted for the 
      variance in symptom reduction. Findings indicate patients with SAD are more likely 
      to benefit from CBT if there is less pre-treatment DLPFC recruitment, a region 
      strongly implicated in emotion regulation. Patients with reduced baseline frontal 
      activation when reappraising negative stimuli may be especially helped by explicit 
      cognitive interventions. Further research is necessary to establish DLPFC as a 
      stable brain-based marker of treatment outcome.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of panic disorder in older patients.
PG  - 881-91
AB  - Panic disorder occurs less frequently in the elderly than in younger adults and 
      rarely starts for the first time in old age. Panic attacks that begin in late life 
      should prompt the clinician to conduct a careful search for a depressive disorder, 
      physical illness or drugs that could be contributing to their presence. When panic 
      attacks do occur in the elderly, the symptoms are qualitatively similar to those 
      experienced by younger people. The elderly, however, may have fewer and less severe 
      symptoms and exhibit less avoidant behaviour. As panic disorder is typically a 
      chronic or recurrent condition, its management requires a long-term approach. With 
      the exception of one descriptive pilot study, there have been no randomised 
      controlled trials of the treatment of panic disorder in later life. Therefore, 
      recommendations regarding the management of this disorder in the elderly must be 
      extrapolated from research pertaining to younger patients. Selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase 
      inhibitors, benzodiazepines and cognitive behavioural therapy are efficacious 
      treatments for panic disorder. There are no consistent differences in efficacy 
      between classes of medications or between pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioural 
      therapy. Furthermore, there are no reliable predictors of response to one type of 
      treatment compared with another. Treatment selection, therefore, depends on an 
      individual assessment of the risks and benefits of each type of treatment (taking 
      into account comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions), patient preference, cost 
      and the availability of therapists skilled in cognitive behavioural techniques. As a 
      general rule, antidepressant medication is preferable to a benzodiazepine as a 
      first-line treatment for panic disorder in the elderly, especially given the high 
      level of comorbidity between panic disorder and depressive disorders. Of the 
      antidepressants, an SSRI is recommended as the initial choice of treatment in older 
      patients. Anxious patients frequently misattribute somatic symptoms of anxiety to 
      adverse effects of medication. Adherence with treatment, therefore, can be enhanced 
      by starting antidepressant medication at a low dosage so as to avoid initial 
      exacerbation of anxiety (but then gradually increasing the dosage to the therapeutic 
      range), frequent follow-up during the first few weeks of treatment, discussion about 
      potential adverse effects and addressing any other concerns the patient may have 
      about taking medication. Given the delayed onset of action of antidepressant 
      medication, the short-term use of adjunctive lorazepam in the first few weeks of 
      treatment may be helpful in selected patients.

TI  - Are there gender differences in catastrophic appraisals in panic disorder with 
      agoraphobia?
PG  - 545-52
AB  - Our aim in this study was to compare panic-related catastrophic appraisals between 
      women and men with panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA). One hundred two 
      outpatients with PDA (75 women and 27 men) participated. Two instruments for the 
      assessment of catastrophic appraisals, Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire and 
      Panic Appraisal Inventory, were administered before and after cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) that also included pharmacotherapy in three-fourths of the patients. 
      Female and male patients did not differ significantly in terms of their tendency to 
      anticipate catastrophic consequences of panic, before or after CBT-based treatment. 
      For both females and males, the tendency to make catastrophic appraisals decreased 
      significantly with treatment. We conclude that among patients with PDA there are no 
      gender differences in catastrophic appraisals of panic sensations and symptoms. The 
      apparently higher risk of panic recurrence in women does not seem to be related to 
      their panic-related catastrophic appraisals. These findings also support a notion 
      that there is no gender difference in response to CBT-based treatment of PDA.

TI  - Mechanisms of change underlying the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy for 
      chronic fatigue syndrome in a specialist clinic: a mediation analysis.
PG  - 1331-44
LID - 10.1017/S0033291713002006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that cognitive 
      behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for chronic fatigue 
      syndrome (CFS). However, little is known about the mechanisms by which the treatment 
      has its effect. The aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanisms of 
      change underlying the efficacy of CBT for CFS. We applied path analysis and 
      introduce novel model comparison approaches to assess a theoretical CBT model that 
      suggests that fearful cognitions will mediate the relationship between avoidance 
      behaviour and illness outcomes (fatigue and social adjustment). METHOD: Data from 
      389 patients with CFS who received CBT in a specialist service in the UK were 
      collected at baseline, at discharge from treatment, and at 3-, 6- and 12-month 
      follow-ups. Path analyses were used to assess possible mediating effects. Model 
      selection using information criteria was used to compare support for competing 
      mediational models. RESULTS: Path analyses were consistent with the hypothesized 
      model in which fear avoidance beliefs at the 3-month follow-up partially mediate the 
      relationship between avoidance behaviour at discharge and fatigue and social 
      adjustment respectively at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The results strengthen the 
      validity of a theoretical model of CBT by confirming the role of cognitive and 
      behavioural factors in CFS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish whether the combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) and pharmacotherapy (SSRI) was more effective in treating panic disorder (PD) 
      than either CBT or SSRI alone, and to evaluate any differential effects between the 
      mono-treatments. METHOD: Patients with PD (n = 150) with or without agoraphobia 
      received CBT, SSRI or CBT + SSRI. Outcome was assessed after 9 months, before 
      medication taper. RESULTS: CBT + SSRI was clearly superior to CBT in both completer 
      and intent-to-treat analysis (ITT). Completer analysis revealed superiority of CBT + 
      SSRI over SSRI on three measures and no differences between CBT and SSRI. ITT 
      analysis revealed superiority of SSRI over CBT on four measures and no differences 
      between CBT + SSRI and SSRI. CONCLUSION: Both the mono-treatments (CBT and SSRI) and 
      the combined treatment (CBT + SSRI) proved to be effective treatments for PD. At 
      post-test, CBT + SSRI was clearly superior to CBT, but differences between CBT + 
      SSRI and SSRI, and between SSRI and CBT, were small.

TI  - FEAR CONDITIONING AND EXTINCTION IN YOUTH WITH OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER.
PG  - 229-37
LID - 10.1002/da.22468 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear acquisition and extinction are central constructs in the 
      cognitive-behavioral model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which underlies 
      exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Youth with OCD may have 
      impairments in fear acquisition and extinction that carry treatment implications. We 
      examined these processes using a differential conditioning procedure. METHODS: 
      Forty-one youth (19 OCD, 22 community comparisons) completed a battery of clinical 
      interviews, rating scales, and a differential conditioning task that included 
      habituation, acquisition, and extinction phases. Skin conductance response (SCR) 
      served as the primary dependent measure. RESULTS: During habituation, no difference 
      between groups was observed. During acquisition, differential fear conditioning was 
      observed across participants as evidenced by larger SCRs to the CS+ compared to CS-; 
      there were no between-group differences. Across participants, the number and 
      frequency of OCD symptoms and anxiety severity was associated with greater 
      reactivity to stimuli during acquisition. During extinction, a three-way interaction 
      and follow-up tests revealed that youth with OCD showed a different pattern of SCR 
      extinction compared to the community comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: Youth with OCD 
      exhibit a different pattern of fear extinction relative to community comparisons. 
      This may be attributed to impaired inhibitory learning and contingency awareness in 
      extinction. Findings suggest the potential benefit of utilizing inhibitory-learning 
      principles in CBT for youth with OCD, and/or augmentative retraining interventions 
      prior to CBT to reduce threat bias and improve contingency detection.

      about panic disorder and available psychological treatments.
PG  - 314-21
LID - 10.1007/s10880-008-9129-4 [doi]
AB  - Under-recognition of somatic symptoms associated with panic in primary care settings 
      results in unnecessary and costly diagnostic procedures and inappropriate referrals 
      to cardiologists, gastroenterologists, and neurologists. In the current study 
      specialists' knowledge regarding the nature and treatment of panic were examined. 
      One-hundred and fourteen specialists completed a questionnaire assessing their 
      knowledge about panic attacks, including their perceptions of psychologists' role in 
      treating panic. Respondents answered 51% of knowledge items correctly. Although most 
      knew the definition of a panic attack, they knew less about clinical features of 
      panic and its treatment. Specifically, whereas 97.4% believed medication effectively 
      relieves panic symptoms, only 32.5% knew that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is 
      a first-line treatment. Only 6% reported knowing how to implement CBT, and only 
      56.1% recognized that psychologists could effectively treat panic. These findings 
      demonstrate significant gaps in specialists' knowledge about panic and the need to 
      enhance physician knowledge about panic attacks and their treatment.

TI  - In-situation safety behaviors among patients with panic disorder: descriptive and 
      correlational study.
PG  - 332-9
LID - 10.1111/pcn.12061 [doi]
AB  - AIM: In-situation safety behaviors play an important role in the maintenance of 
      anxiety because they prevent patients from experiencing unambiguous disconfirmation 
      of their unrealistic beliefs about feared catastrophes. Strategies for identifying 
      particular safety behaviors, however, have not been sufficiently investigated. The 
      aims of the present study were to (i) develop a comprehensive list of safety 
      behaviors seen in panic disorder and to examine their frequency; and (ii) correlate 
      the safety behaviors with panic attack symptoms, agoraphobic situations and 
      treatment response. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 46 consecutive patients who 
      participated in group cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for panic disorder. All 
      the patients completed a Safety Behavior List that was developed based on 
      experiences with panic disorder patients. RESULTS: Carrying medications, distracting 
      attention, carrying a plastic bottle, and drinking water were reported by more than 
      half of the patients. The strongest correlations between panic symptoms and safety 
      behaviors were found between symptoms of derealization and listening to music with 
      headphones, paresthesia and pushing a cart while shopping, and nausea and squatting 
      down. The strongest association between agoraphobic situations and safety behaviors 
      was found between the fear of taking a bus or a train alone and moving around. 
      Staying still predicted response to the CBT program, while concentrating on 
      something predicted lack of response. CONCLUSION: An approximate guideline has been 
      developed for identifying safety behaviors among patients with panic disorder and 
      should help clinicians use CBT more effectively for these patients.

LID - 10.3109/00016357.2011.635600 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate quality-of-life (QoL), before and after cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) in patients diagnosed with intra-oral injection phobia according to 
      DSM-IV and to compare with the general population. This study also aimed to evaluate 
      if QoL was associated with self-reported injection anxiety, dental anxiety, time 
      since last dental treatment and oral health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were 55 
      patients (mean age 35.5 ± 12.2, 78.2% women) who participated in a treatment study 
      in which 89% managed an intra-oral injection at 1 year follow-up. The patients 
      completed a set of questionnaires including Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI), 
      Injection Phobia Scale-Anxiety, Dental Anxiety Scale and a single-item question 
      assessing self-perceived oral health. Objective measures of oral health and 
      treatment needs were based on clinical examination. QOLI-scores from a non-clinical 
      sample were used for comparison. RESULTS: Before treatment the general and health 
      specific QoL were lower among intra-oral injection phobics than in the non-clinical 
      sample. At 1 year follow-up the QoL in general had improved significantly and was 
      similar to that of the non-clinical sample. Poor self-reported oral health and 
      long-term avoidance of dental treatment were associated with lower general and 
      health-specific QoL. Self-reported injection anxiety and dental anxiety were not 
      associated with QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with intra-oral injection phobia report 
      lower QoL compared with a general population. Phobia treatment seems to increase QoL 
      to normative levels. Self-perceived poor oral health is associated with reduced QoL 
      in these patients.

PG  - 574-86
LID - 10.4088/JCP.08m04681blu [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the long-term effectiveness of 3 treatments for DSM-IV panic 
      disorder with or without agoraphobia: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 
      pharmacotherapy using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), or the 
      combination of both (CBT + SSRI). As a secondary objective, the relationship between 
      treatment outcome and 7 predictor variables was investigated. METHOD: Patients were 
      enrolled between April 2001 and September 2003 and were randomly assigned to 
      treatment. Academic and nonacademic clinical sites participated. Each treatment 
      modality lasted 1 year. Pharmacotherapists were free to choose between 5 SSRIs 
      currently marketed in The Netherlands. Outcome was assessed after 9 months of 
      treatment (posttest 1), after discontinuation of treatment (posttest 2), and 6 and 
      12 months after treatment discontinuation (follow-up 1 and follow-up 2). RESULTS: In 
      the sample (N = 150), 48% did not suffer from agoraphobia or suffered from only mild 
      agoraphobia, while 52% suffered from moderate or severe agoraphobia. Patients in 
      each treatment group improved significantly from pretest to posttest 1 on the 
      primary outcome measures of level of anxiety (P < .001), degree of coping (P < 
      .001), and remitter status (P < .001), as well as on the secondary outcome measures 
      of depressive symptomatology (P < .001), and from pretest to posttest 2 for 
      health-related quality of life (P < .001). Gains were preserved from posttest 2 
      throughout the follow-up period. Some superiority of CBT + SSRI and SSRI as compared 
      with CBT was observed at posttest 1. However, at both follow-ups, differences 
      between treatment modalities proved nonsignificant. Client satisfaction appeared to 
      be high at treatment endpoint, while patients receiving CBT + SSRI appeared slightly 
      (P < .05) more satisfied than those receiving CBT only. CONCLUSIONS: No fall-off in 
      gains was observed for either treatment modality after treatment discontinuation. 
      SSRIs were associated with adverse events. Gains produced by CBT were slower to 
      emerge than those produced by CBT + SSRI and SSRI, but CBT ended sooner. TRIAL

TI  - Treating medication-resistant panic disorder: predictors and outcome of 
      cognitive-behavior therapy in a Brazilian public hospital.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Brazil, treatment of panic disorder is most frequently initiated with 
      pharmacotherapy, but only half of the patients can be expected to be panic free 
      after medication. Studies have suggested that individual or group cognitive-behavior 
      therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment strategy for panic patients who have failed 
      to respond to pharmacotherapy. METHODS: Thirty-two patients diagnosed with panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia having residual symptoms despite being on an adequate dose 
      of medication were treated with 12 weeks of group CBT. The outcome was evaluated for 
      panic frequency and severity, generalized anxiety, and global severity. Comorbid 
      conditions, a childhood history of anxiety, and defense mechanism styles were 
      assessed as potential predictors of treatment response. RESULTS: Twenty-nine 
      patients completed the 12-week protocol. Treatment was associated with significant 
      reductions in symptom severity on all outcome measures (p < 0.001). Patients with 
      depression had a poorer outcome of the treatment (p = 0.01) as did patients using 
      more neurotic (p = 0.002) and immature defenses (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Consistent 
      with previous reports, we found that CBT was effective for our sample of 
      treatment-resistant patients. Among these patients, depression as well as neurotic 
      defense style was associated with a poorer outcome. The use of CBT in Brazil for 
      treatment-resistant and other panic patients is encouraged.

TI  - [Deleterious Results of Safety Seeking Behaviours in Panic Disorder: Polydipsia and 
      Diabetes Mellitus Type 2].
PG  - 286-289
AB  - Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder that involves recurrent panic attacks, which 
      emerge when a harmless stimulus is interpreted as "catastrophic". In an attempt to 
      avoid the panic attack or prevent confrontation, the patient exhibits a 
      dysfunctional attitude and behavior, such as evasion and safety-seeking behavior 
      (SSB). Dysfunctional behavior leads to an increase in the recurrence of panic 
      attacks and affects the patient's life in a negative way. According to the cognitive 
      behavioral therapy model, SSB contributes to the continuation of unrealistic beliefs 
      (e.g. physical experiences) regarding and prevents the patient from grasping new 
      information that may potentially contradict the unrealistic cognitions. In this 
      paper, we present a case with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder. Interestingly, 
      this patient developed diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 and psychogenic polydipsia 
      (PPD) as a consequence of his SSB. PPD is a common occurrence in patients with 
      psychiatric disorders, especially in schizophrenia. Up to now, no case of a panic 
      disorder with either DM or PPD has been reported in the literature. While it is 
      accepted that major depression poses a risk for DM type 2, panic disorder may also 
      increase this risk. Treatment of the panic disorder with cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) resulted in improvement of PPD and DM type 2. In conclusion, the role 
      of SSB in medical disorders accompanied by psychiatric disorders should be kept in 
      mind when treating these patients.

TI  - A comparison of medication side effect reports by panic disorder patients with and 
      without concomitant cognitive behavior therapy.
PG  - 273-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed whether adding cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to 
      imipramine for patients with panic disorder decreased the severity of side effects 
      and dropouts from side effects. METHOD: Data were analyzed for 172 panic disorder 
      patients who were randomly assigned to receive imipramine alone, imipramine plus 
      CBT, or placebo. Mixed-effects models were used to assess longitudinal differences 
      among the treatment groups with respect to side effect burden and dropout rates 
      during the acute, maintenance, and follow-up phases of treatment. RESULTS: Patients 
      treated with imipramine plus CBT experienced less severe fatigue/weakness, dry 
      mouth, and sweating and had a lower rate of dropout due to side effects compared 
      with those treated with imipramine only. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of CBT to 
      medication treatment with imipramine was associated with less severe side effects 
      and fewer dropouts due to perceived side effects than treatment with imipramine 
      alone.

TI  - The Impact of Treatment Expectations on Exposure Process and Treatment Outcome in 
      Childhood Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - 79-89
LID - 10.1007/s10802-019-00574-x [doi]
AB  - This study examined the relationship between caregivers' and youths' treatment 
      expectations and characteristics of exposure tasks (quantity, mastery, compliance) 
      in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety. Additionally, 
      compliance with exposure tasks was tested as a mediator of the relationship between 
      treatment expectations and symptom improvement. Data were from youth (N = 279; 
      7-17 years old) enrolled in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) and 
      randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or the combination of CBT and 
      sertraline for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety 
      disorder, and social phobia. Caregivers and youth independently reported treatment 
      expectations prior to randomization, anxiety was assessed pre- and post-treatment by 
      independent evaluators blind to treatment condition, and exposure characteristics 
      were recorded by the cognitive-behavioral therapists following each session. For 
      both caregivers and youths, more positive expectations that anxiety would improve 
      with treatment were associated with greater compliance with exposure tasks, and 
      compliance mediated the relationship between treatment expectations and change in 
      anxiety symptoms following treatment. Additionally, more positive parent treatment 
      expectations were related to a greater number and percentage of sessions with 
      exposure. More positive youth treatment expectations were associated with greater 
      mastery during sessions focused on exposure. Findings underscore the importance of 
      addressing parents' and youths' treatment expectations at the outset of therapy to 
      facilitate engagement in exposure and maximize therapeutic gains.

AB  - The understanding of BDD and its treatment has expanded significantly in the past 
      decade as controlled research has followed the leads from case reports and clinical 
      experience. BDD is recognized as a severe, disabling disorder that is more common 
      that had been assumed. Although BDD is still difficult to treat, success has been 
      demonstrated for SRIs and CBT. Much remains to be discovered. To date, little is 
      known about the causes and pathophysiology of BDD. Research that would illuminate 
      these also would increase understanding of its relationship to other disorders, such 
      as OCD, depression, and social phobia, and open up possibilities for prevention and 
      new approaches to treatment. Investigations in brain imaging and genetics are 
      underway. Research in pharmacotherapy and CBT, individually and combined, is needed 
      to refine, extend, and optimize treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amygdala is considered as the core pathogenesis of generalized social 
      anxiety disorder (GSAD). However, it is still unclear whether effective group 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could modulate the function of amygdala-related 
      network. We aimed to examine the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the 
      amygdala before and after group CBT. METHODS: Fifteen patients with GSAD were 
      scanned on a 3T MR system before and after 8 weeks of group CBT. For comparison, 
      nineteen healthy control participants also underwent baseline fMRI scanning. We used 
      bilateral amygdala as seed regions and the rsFC maps of the right and left amygdala 
      were created separately in a voxel-wise way. Clusters survived two-tailed Gaussian 
      Random Field (GRF) correction at p <0.05 (voxel z value >2.3). RESULTS: Compared 
      with baseline, patients with CBT showed significantly decreased connectivity of the 
      left amygdala with the right putamen, the left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex 
      (dmPFC) and the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Especially, the 
      changes of the connectivity between the left amygdala and the dACC positively 
      correlated with changes of the anxiety symptom in patients. Furthermore, in relative 
      to controls, patients showed higher connectivity of left amygdala with dmPFC and 
      dACC at baseline, while normal after CBT. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term group CBT could 
      down-regulate the abnormal higher connectivity of prefrontal-amygdala network, along 
      with clinical improvement. This may provide a potential biomarker to monitor the 
      treatment effect of CBT in GSAD patients.

TI  - Anxiety in anorexia nervosa and its management using family-based treatment.
PG  - e1-16

AB  - Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by its similarity to anxiety disorders, 
      especially obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Family-based treatment (FBT) has 
      shown promising initial results for treatment of AN in adolescents, yet the precise 
      mechanisms of action are unknown. We present a theoretical argument and model, 
      suggesting that FBT may work via exposure (and habituation) to food and its 
      consumption. First, we review the evidence for pathological anxiety in AN, and 
      suggest a framework for identifying specific anxious triggers, emotions (fear and 
      worry) and avoidance strategies. Second, we briefly review evidence indicating that 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and specifically exposure in its various forms 
      is most effective for treating anxiety disorders in youth. Third, we consider 
      distinct approaches to exposure therapy based on the pattern of triggers, anxious 
      emotions and avoidance. We conclude that the interventions utilized in FBT share 
      clear similarities to exposure with response prevention, a type of exposure therapy 
      commonly used with OCD, and may work via facilitating habituation to food and eating 
      in one's natural environment. We also highlight how parents facilitate this process 
      in between sessions by effectively coaching their children and facilitating 
      naturalistic exposure to food and related triggers. Options for future research are 
      considered.

TI  - I think I'm Going to be Sick: An Eight-Year-Old Boy with Emetophobia and Secondary 
      Food Restriction.
PG  - 104-109
AB  - We present a case of an eight-year-old boy with a specific phobia of vomiting who 
      developed subsequent food restriction and weight loss. Our case report includes a 
      review of treatment modalities for specific phobias including cognitive behavioural 
      and exposure therapy in young children and the importance of parental involvement in 
      the treatment process. After an initial assessment and diagnosis of this boy with 
      emetophobia, treatment took place over ten subsequent visits, one hour each in 
      duration. His treatment included a cognitive approach utilizing exposure therapy to 
      re-introduce foods to his diet, working through a fear hierarchy, addressing 
      cognitive distortions/misconceptions and psychoeducational supports. Intermittent 
      reinforcement was applied to help extinguish what we believe was an associatively 
      learned fear of vomiting. Outcomes of the treatment were measured by changes in 
      behaviour and overall increase in food intake reported by the patient's parents. On 
      completion of treatment, the family was no longer concerned with the amount and 
      variety of food he was eating, the patient reported less nausea, and he was more 
      likely to eat in public. A post-treatment three-week telephone follow-up showed 
      continued gains. Congruent with reported literature , this case confirms and 
      highlights the efficacy of exposure therapy and age-appropriate cognitive treatment 
      adaptations in treatment of emetophobia. In addition, parental education and 
      participation is recommended in treatment of child cases.

TI  - Differential responses of positive affect, negative affect, and worry in CBT for 
      generalized anxiety disorder: A person-specific analysis of symptom course during 
      therapy.
PG  - 630-642
LID - 10.1080/10503307.2016.1233366 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Research indicates that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder 
      (GAD) may experience deficits in positive affect (PA), and tend to dampen or 
      intentionally suppress PA. Despite the presence of PA-related pathology in GAD, 
      little is known about change in PA during GAD treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      examines changes in PA, negative affect (NA) and worry in seven participants during 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for GAD. METHOD: Intensive repeated measures 
      (i.e., time series) data were subjected to person-specific regression analysis to 
      delineate individual change trajectories. RESULTS: Significant improvement in worry 
      was observed in all but one participant. Fear and irritability - indices of NA - 
      each improved in 5/7 participants while sadness improved in 4/7 participants 
      (worsening in one). Of all symptom domains, PA had the poorest treatment response: 
      PA improved in only 2/7 participants and actually significantly worsened in 5/7 
      individuals even as NA and worry improved during therapy. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      indicate that treatment gains from traditional CBT for GAD may not generalize to 
      improvements in PA regulation, or even emotional functioning more broadly. This 
      evidence is a call to increase the focus on PA regulation in treatment for GAD; 
      perhaps PA could be a missing piece in our understanding of ways to bolster GAD 
      treatment outcomes.

TI  - Potential mechanisms involved in the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on 
      fatigue severity in Type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 330-340
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000290 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify mediators of the beneficial effect of cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) on fatigue severity in chronically fatigued patients with Type 1 
      diabetes. METHOD: We performed secondary analyses of a randomized controlled trial 
      testing the efficacy of CBT. Primary outcome was fatigue severity assessed with the 
      Checklist Individual Strength, subscale fatigue severity. We used multiple mediation 
      analysis to determine potential mediators of the treatment effect. Proposed 
      mediators were symptom focusing, self-efficacy concerning fatigue and pain, 
      perceived activity, sleep disturbances, confidence in diabetes self-care, diabetes 
      distress and discrepancy regarding social support. Actigraphy was used to assess the 
      level of physical activity. The analysis was repeated with depressive symptoms as 
      potential mediator to test whether this caused a change in the other fatigue-related 
      mediators. RESULTS: The effect of CBT on fatigue severity was partly mediated by a 
      change in symptom focusing (-1.39, 95% CI [-3.32, -0.19]), fear avoidance (-1.10, 
      95% CI [-2.49, -0.22]), self-efficacy concerning fatigue (-1.95, 95% CI [-4.51, 
      -0.40]), and perceived physical activity (-2.44, 95% CI [-4.53, -1.07]). Depressive 
      symptoms were also a mediator (-1.22, 95% CI [-2.56, -0.38]), but the aforementioned 
      fatigue-perpetuating factors still explained part of the treatment effect. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Changes in cognitions about fatigue and activity, and a change in 
      depressive symptoms partly mediated the treatment effect of CBT on fatigue severity 
      in Type 1 diabetes. The mediators found are similar to those explaining the effects 
      of CBT in other chronic diseases. This provides knowledge for the development of 
      more effective and efficient interventions for fatigue. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - This study examined (a) demographic and clinical characteristics associated with 
      sleep-related problems (SRPs) among youth with anxiety disorders, and (b) the impact 
      of anxiety treatment: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping Cat), medication 
      (sertraline), their combination, and pill placebo on SRPs. Youth (N = 488, ages 
      7-17, 50% female, 79% White) with a principal diagnosis of generalized anxiety 
      disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or social phobia participated. SRPs were 
      reported by parents and youth. Findings differed by informant and by type of SRP, 
      with evidence that SRPs are associated with age, anxiety severity, externalizing 
      problems, functional impairment, and family burden at pretreatment. Anxiety 
      treatment reduced SRPs; effect sizes were small to medium. Reductions in 
      parent-reported separation-related sleep difficulties were significantly greater in 
      active treatment than in the placebo condition, with the greatest reductions 
      reported by parents of youth whose active treatment was multimodal or included 
      sertraline. Youth whose anxiety treatment involved CBT reported significantly 
      greater decreases in dysregulated sleep (e.g., sleeplessness). Both CBT for anxiety 
      and sertraline appear to be somewhat effective in reducing SRPs, and multimodal 
      treatment may be preferable depending on the symptom presentation. To inform 
      practice, future research should examine a broad range of SRPs, incorporate 
      objective measures of sleep, and evaluate the impact of behavioral strategies that 
      directly target SRPs in youth with anxiety disorders.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy for women with lifelong vaginismus: process and 
      prognostic factors.
PG  - 359-73
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) seems an effective treatment of lifelong 
      vaginismus, but mechanisms of action have not yet been established. The present 
      study explored whether the effect of CBT for lifelong vaginismus is mediated by 
      changes in fear of penetration and avoidance behavior, which CBT explicitly aims to 
      alter. A second aim of this study was to predict treatment outcome on the basis of 
      pre-treatment variables. Participants with lifelong vaginismus were allocated at 
      random to a 3-months CBT (n=81) or a waiting-list control condition (n=36). Full 
      vaginal penetration with the penis of the partner constituted the primary outcome 
      measure. Change scores in successful 'non-coital penetrative-behavior' and 'fear of 
      coitus' were used to measure the mediating variables. Treatment resulted in an 
      increase of intercourse (outcome), a decrease in fear of coitus, and an enhancement 
      of successful non-coital penetration behavior, compared with no treatment. Outcome 
      (intercourse) was partly mediated by changes in fear of coitus and changes in 
      avoidance behavior. No treatment predictors could be detected in this study sample. 
      It is concluded that techniques such as gradual exposure, aimed at decreasing 
      avoidance behavior and penetration fear, constitute an important avenue of change in 
      the treatment of lifelong vaginismus.

TI  - Interoceptive hypersensitivity and interoceptive exposure in patients with panic 
      disorder: specificity and effectiveness.
PG  - 32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interoceptive exposure has been validated as an effective component of 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of panic disorder but has 
      hitherto received little research attention. We examined the effectiveness of 
      various interoceptive exposure exercises using the Body Sensations Questionnaire 
      (BSQ) (Chambless et al., 1984). METHODS: We first performed an exploratory principal 
      factor analysis of all the items contained in the BSQ to obtain meaningful 
      dimensions of interoceptive fears. Next, we examined the correlations between each 
      interoceptive exposure task's degree of similarity to panic attacks and each BSQ 
      factor and then examined whether the BSQ factor scores decreased in comparison with 
      the baseline values when the corresponding exposure tasks were successfully 
      completed by the subjects. RESULTS: The factor analyses revealed four factors, which 
      we named "pseudoneurological fears", "gastrointestinal fears", "cardiorespiratory 
      fears" and "fears of dissociative feelings." Among the nine interoceptive exposure 
      tasks, 'hyperventilation', 'shaking head', 'holding breath' and 'chest breathing' 
      were considered to reproduce pseudoneurological symptoms, 'breathing through a 
      straw' was considered to reproduce gastrointestinal symptoms, and 'spinning' was 
      considered to reproduce both pseudoneurological and dissociative symptoms; none of 
      the interoceptive exercises were found to reproduce cardiorespiratory symptoms. 
      Among each group of patients for whom 'hyperventilation', 'holding breath', 
      'spinning' or 'chest breathing' was effective, a significant improvement in the BSQ 
      pseudoneurological fears factor scores was observed. On the other hand, no 
      significant difference between the baseline and endpoint values of the BSQ 
      gastrointestinal fears or the BSQ fears of dissociative feelings factor scores were 
      observed among the patients for whom 'spinning' or 'breathing through a straw' was 
      effective. CONCLUSION: Several interoceptive exposure tasks were particularly 
      effective in reducing pseudoneurological fears. New interoceptive tasks, especially 
      tasks related to cardiorespiratory and dissociative feelings, are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A proportion of patients with panic disorder (PD) fail to show a 
      remission after psychotherapy. Biological correlates of psychotherapy non-response 
      have rarely been described in the literature. The aim of the present study was to 
      research the relationship between the cortisol stress response and the psychotherapy 
      outcome in PD patients. METHODS: Twenty-eight PD patients (20 females, mean age±SD: 
      35.71±13.18) seeking psychological treatment for PD and n=32 age- and sex-matched 
      healthy control participants (21 females, aged 34.66±12.07) participated in this 
      study. The patients underwent five weeks of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). 
      Within the first two weeks of the CBT, both study groups were confronted with the 
      Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Blood sampling for cortisol and adrenocorticotropic 
      hormone (ACTH) evaluation as well as fear-rating (Visual Analogue Scale; Primary 
      Appraisal and Secondary Appraisal Questionnaire, PASA) accompanied the TSST. The 
      global severity of PD (Panic & Agoraphobia Scale; PAS), agoraphobic cognitions 
      (Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire; ACQ), fear of bodily sensations (Bodily 
      Sensations Questionnaire; BSQ), agoraphobic avoidance (Mobility Inventory; MI), and 
      depressiveness (Beck Depression Inventory; BDI) were assessed before and after the 
      CBT (except the BDI). RESULTS: The statistical analysis revealed significant main 
      effects of time for cortisol and the ACTH concentration in response to the TSST, 
      independently of the study group. 42.9% of the PD patients and 65.6% of the healthy 
      control participants showed a cortisol stress response to the TSST≥55.2nmol/l 
      (descriptive finding). The data showed a significant inverse association of the TSST 
      cortisol stress response with the MI total score when accompanied. Further, a 
      significant association of the PASA subjective level of fear and the BSQ as well as 
      a trend for an association of the PASA with the ACQ were observed. CONCLUSION: 
      Consistent with prior research, we could replicate findings of decreased cortisol 
      concentrations in the PD patients in comparison to the healthy control participants. 
      Furthermore, our findings agree with previous data showing an association of the 
      attenuated cortisol stress response with the psychotherapy non-response. In the 
      present sample, those patients with the lowest cortisol concentrations showed the 
      least improvement in agoraphobic avoidance after psychotherapy. The patients with 
      the highest level of fear showed the most improvement in fear of bodily sensations. 
      Study limitations as well as implications for future studies will be discussed.

      narrative and treatment length.
PG  - 67-75
LID - 10.1002/da.20744 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Child sexual abuse (CSA) is associated with the development of a variety 
      of mental health disorders, and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) 
      is an established treatment for children who have experienced CSA. However, there 
      are questions about how many TF-CBT sessions should be delivered to achieve clinical 
      efficacy and whether a trauma narrative (TN) component is essential. This study 
      examined the differential effects of TF-CBT with or without the TN component in 8 
      versus 16 sessions. METHODS: Two hundred and ten children (aged 4-11 years) referred 
      for CSA and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were randomly assigned to one of 
      the four treatment conditions: 8 sessions with no TN, 8 sessions with TN, 16 
      sessions with no TN, and 16 sessions with TN. RESULTS: Mixed-model ANCOVAs 
      demonstrated that significant posttreatment improvements had occurred with respect 
      to 14 outcome measures across all conditions. Significant main and interactive 
      effect differences were found across conditions with respect to specific outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TF-CBT, regardless of the number of sessions or the inclusion of a TN 
      component, was effective in improving participant symptomatology as well as 
      parenting skills and the children's personal safety skills. The eight session 
      condition that included the TN component seemed to be the most effective and 
      efficient means of ameliorating parents' abuse-specific distress as well as 
      children's abuse-related fear and general anxiety. On the other hand, parents 
      assigned to the 16 session, no narrative condition reported greater increases in 
      effective parenting practices and fewer externalizing child behavioral problems at 
      posttreatment.

TI  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Children with Dental Anxiety: A Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 234-243
LID - 10.1177/2380084416661473 [doi]
AB  - Dental anxiety affects approximately 9% of children and is associated with poor oral 
      health, pain, and psychosocial problems. The objective of this study was to 
      investigate the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for children with 
      dental anxiety in specialist pediatric dentistry. The study used a parallel-group 
      superiority randomized controlled trial design. The primary outcome measure was the 
      behavioral avoidance test; assessors were blind to treatment allocation. 
      Participants were 8 boys and 22 girls 7 to 18 y old (mean ± SD, 10 ± 3.1). Children 
      fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for dental anxiety were randomized to CBT (n = 
      13) or treatment as usual (n = 17), such as various sedation methods. Psychologists 
      provided 10 h of CBT based on a treatment manual. Treatments were conducted in a 
      naturalistic real-world clinical setting. Assessments were conducted before the 
      treatment, 3 mo after the start of treatment, and at 1-y follow-up. The analyses of 
      the primary outcome measure by repeated-measures analysis of variance and 
      independent t test showed that children receiving CBT made superior, statistically 
      significant improvements at follow-up (16.8 ± 2.4) compared with treatment as usual 
      (11.4 ± 3.1, P < 0.01). A large between-group effect size (Cohen's d = 1.9) was 
      found. Following treatment, 73% of those in the CBT group managed all stages of the 
      dental procedures included in the behavioral avoidance test compared with 13% in the 
      treatment-as-usual group. Furthermore, 91% in the CBT group compared with 25% in the 
      treatment-as-usual group no longer met the diagnostic criteria for dental anxiety at 
      the 1-y follow-up according to the secondary outcome measure. Measures of dental 
      anxiety and self-efficacy showed larger improvements in the CBT group compared with 
      controls. We conclude that CBT is an efficacious treatment for children and 
      adolescents with dental anxiety and should be made accessible in pediatric dentistry 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01798355). Knowledge transfer statement: The results of this 
      study can be used by decision makers and clinicians when planning to implement 
      evidence-based treatment in pediatric dentistry and give children and adolescents 
      access to methods for treating dental anxiety. The results can also be used by 
      parents of children with dental anxiety when asking dentists to cooperate with 
      psychologists using cognitive behavioral therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impaired fear inhibition has been described as a hallmark of 
      pathological anxiety. We aimed at further characterizing the relation between fear 
      inhibition and anxiety by extending previous work to contextual safety stimuli as 
      well as to dimensional scores of trait anxiety in a large sample. METHODS: We 
      employed a validated paradigm for context-dependent fear acquisition/extinction (day 
      1) and retrieval/expression (day 2) in 377 healthy individuals. This large sample 
      size allowed the employment of a dimensional rather than binary approach with 
      respect to individual differences in trait anxiety. RESULTS: We observed a positive 
      correlation on day 1 between trait anxiety with all CSs that possess an inherent 
      inhibitory component, conveyed either by reliable non-reinforcement of a specific CS 
      in a dangerous context (safe cue) or by the context itself (i.e., safe context). No 
      correlation however was observed for a CS that possesses excitatory (threatening) 
      properties only. These results were observed during fear learning (day 1) for US 
      expectancy and fear ratings but not for SCRs. No such pattern was evident during 
      fear and extinction retrieval/expression (day 2). CONCLUSION: We provide further 
      evidence that high trait anxiety is associated with the inability to take immediate 
      advantage of environmental safety cues (cued and contextual), which might represent 
      a promising trans-diagnostic marker for different anxiety disorders. Consequently, 
      the incorporation of methods to optimize inhibitory learning in current cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) treatments might open up a promising avenue for precision 
      medicine in anxiety disorders. LIMITATIONS: We did not include patients diagnosed 
      with anxiety disorders.

TI  - Temporal patterns of change in panic disorder during cognitive behaviour therapy: an 
      Indian study.
PG  - 513-25
LID - 10.1017/S1352465813000635 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: CBT has been proven to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder; 
      however, attempts to study the process of change are limited. AIM: The study 
      evaluated the temporal patterns of change in the panic symptoms, cognitions, 
      behaviours, and anxiety sensitivity in subjects with panic disorder being treated 
      with CBT. METHOD: Thirty subjects with panic disorder were allocated to two groups: 
      Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT, n = 15) and Behaviour Therapy (BT, n = 15). 
      Assessments were carried out weekly for five consecutive weeks using the 
      Semi-Structured Interview Schedule, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Agoraphobic 
      Cognitions Questionnaire, and the Texas Panic Attack Record Form. The CBT group 
      received comprehensive CBT and the BT group received psycho-education and Applied 
      Relaxation. RESULTS: Following intervention the change was continuous and gradual on 
      all the variables in the CBT group and the scores reduced to a functional range 
      after 4-5 weeks of therapy. Such a change was not evident in the BT group. 
      Significant change was evident in cognitive domains following the introduction of 
      the exposure and cognitive restructuring within the CBT group. Both cognitive and 
      behavioural techniques contributed to the overall change. CONCLUSION: CBT had an 
      impact on the cognitive domains and significant changes were evident corresponding 
      to the addition of cognitive restructuring and exposure techniques in the 3rd to 5th 
      week. Both cognitive and behavioural components are therefore crucial for overall 
      improvement to occur.

TI  - Virtual reality exposure in anxiety disorders: impact on psychophysiological 
      reactivity.
PG  - 427-42
LID - 10.3109/15622975.2014.892632 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Anxiety disorders are among the most frequently encountered psychiatric 
      disorders. Recommended treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and/or 
      medication. In recent years, beneficial effects of virtual reality (VR) exposure 
      therapy have been shown, making this technique a promising addition to CBT. However, 
      the ability of VR to mimic threatening stimuli in a way comparable to in vivo cues 
      has been discussed. In particular, it has been questioned whether VR is capable of 
      provoking psychophysiological symptoms of anxiety. Since psychophysiological arousal 
      is considered a prerequisite for effective exposure treatment, this systematic 
      review aims to evaluate the evidence for the potential of VR exposure to evoke and 
      modulate psychophysiological fear reactions. METHODS: PubMed and PsycINFO/Academic 
      Search Premier databases were searched. Thirty-eight studies investigating challenge 
      or habituation effects were included. RESULTS: VR exposure does provoke 
      psychophysiological arousal, especially in terms of electrodermal activity. Results 
      on psychophysiological habituation in VR are inconclusive. Study design and 
      methodological rigour vary widely. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several limitations, this 
      review provides evidence that VR exposure elicits psychophysiological fear reactions 
      in patients and healthy subjects, rendering VR a promising treatment for anxiety 
      disorders, and a potent research tool for future investigations of 
      psychophysiological processes and their significance during exposure treatment.

TI  - Evidence-based psychological treatments for late-life anxiety.
PG  - 8-17
AB  - This project identified evidence-based psychotherapy treatments for anxiety 
      disorders in older adults. The authors conducted a review of the geriatric anxiety 
      treatment outcome literature by using specific coding criteria and identified 17 
      studies that met criteria for evidence-based treatments (EBTs). These studies 
      reflected samples of adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or samples with 
      mixed anxiety disorders or symptoms. Evidence was found for efficacy for 4 types of 
      EBTs. Relaxation training, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and, to a lesser 
      extent, supportive therapy and cognitive therapy have support for treating 
      subjective anxiety symptoms and disorders. CBT for late-life GAD has garnered the 
      most consistent support, and relaxation training represents an efficacious, 
      relatively low-cost intervention. The authors provide a review of the strengths and 
      limitations of this research literature, including a discussion of common assessment 
      instruments. Continued investigation of EBTs is needed in clinical geriatric anxiety 
      samples, given the small number of available studies. Future research should examine 
      other therapy models and investigate the effects of psychotherapy on other anxiety 
      disorders, such as phobias and posttraumatic stress disorder in older adults.

TI  - Testing the metacognitive model against the benchmark CBT model of social anxiety 
      disorder: Is it time to move beyond cognition?
PG  - e0177109
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0177109 [doi]
LID - e0177109
AB  - The recommended treatment for Social Phobia is individual Cognitive-Behavioural 
      Therapy (CBT). CBT-treatments emphasize social self-beliefs (schemas) as the core 
      underlying factor for maladaptive self-processing and social anxiety symptoms. 
      However, the need for such beliefs in models of psychopathology has recently been 
      questioned. Specifically, the metacognitive model of psychological disorders asserts 
      that particular beliefs about thinking (metacognitive beliefs) are involved in most 
      disorders, including social anxiety, and are a more important factor underlying 
      pathology. Comparing the relative importance of these disparate underlying belief 
      systems has the potential to advance conceptualization and treatment for SAD. In the 
      cognitive model, unhelpful self-regulatory processes (self-attention and safety 
      behaviours) arise from (e.g. correlate with) cognitive beliefs (schemas) whilst the 
      metacognitive model proposes that such processes arise from metacognitive beliefs. 
      In the present study we therefore set out to evaluate the absolute and relative fit 
      of the cognitive and metacognitive models in a longitudinal data-set, using 
      structural equation modelling. Five-hundred and five (505) participants completed a 
      battery of self-report questionnaires at two time points approximately 8 weeks 
      apart. We found that both models fitted the data, but that the metacognitive model 
      was a better fit to the data than the cognitive model. Further, a specified 
      metacognitive model, emphasising negative metacognitive beliefs about the 
      uncontrollability and danger of thoughts and cognitive confidence improved the model 
      fit further and was significantly better than the cognitive model. It would seem 
      that advances in understanding and treating social anxiety could benefit from moving 
      to a full metacognitive theory that includes negative metacognitive beliefs about 
      the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts, and judgements of cognitive 
      confidence. These findings challenge a core assumption of the cognitive model and 
      treatment of social phobia and offer further support to the metacognitive model.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a developmentally appropriate 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol for preschoolers with severe nighttime fears 
      and sleep-related problems, with an active control treatment. METHODS: Ninety 
      children aged four to six years (63% boys) with severe nighttime fears and their 
      parents were randomized to either cognitive-behavioral therapy including parent 
      involved play (CBT-PIP) or to a structurally equivalent non-directive treatment 
      (TEPT; triadic expressive play therapy). Treatment conditions were also equivalent 
      in parent- and child-rated credibility and expectancy, and in therapist-rated 
      compliance. Children and parents were assessed at baseline, during the first 
      intervention week and four weeks after treatment. Measures included actigraphy, 
      daily sleep logs, structured diagnostic interviews and parent questionnaires. 
      RESULTS: Significant reductions were observed in nighttime fears and objectively and 
      subjectively measured sleep disruptions in both intervention groups following 
      treatment. Parent reports indicated more advantageous outcomes for CBT-PIP compared 
      to TEPT, with greater reductions in sleep problems and co-sleeping as well as higher 
      customer satisfaction in the former group. CONCLUSIONS: While CBT-PIP showed no 
      significant advantage compared to the active control in reducing fears or in 
      improving objectively measured sleep, it was significantly more beneficial in 
      reducing the adverse behavioral features of nighttime fears.

TI  - Implementing panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy into clinical practice.
PG  - 326-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of manualized panic-focused psychodynamic 
      psychotherapy (PFPP) in routine care in Germany. METHOD: German psychoanalysts were 
      trained according to the PFPP manual. Fifty-four consecutive outpatients with panic 
      disorder (with or without agoraphobia) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to PFPP 
      or cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) plus exposure therapy. Subjects (female 
      57.4%; mean age 36.2 years) had high rates of psychiatric (68.5%) and somatic 
      (64.8%) comorbidity, and previous psychiatric treatments (57.4%). Assessments were 
      performed pre- and posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome 
      measure was the Panic Disorder Severity Scale. RESULTS: Both treatments were highly 
      effective. In patients randomized to PFPP, remission was achieved in 44.4% at 
      termination and by 50% at follow-up (CBT 61.1% and 55.6%, respectively). No 
      significant differences were found. Emotional awareness, a posited moderator of good 
      outcome in psychotherapies, was significantly higher in the CBT group at baseline. 
      It was found to be a strong moderator of treatment effectiveness in both treatments. 
      After adjusting for initial Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) scores, 
      effect sizes (ESs) for the primary outcome were Cohen d = 1.28, from pre- to 
      posttreatment, and d = 1.03, from pretreatment to follow-up, for PFPP, and d = 1.81 
      and 1.28 for CBT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PFPP was implemented effectively into 
      clinical practice by psychoanalysts in the community in a sample with severe mental 
      illness with large ESs. Assessment of LEAS may facilitate the identification of 
      patients suitable for short-term psychotherapy. ( CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF D-CYCLOSERINE ENHANCEMENT OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR 
      PANIC DISORDER.
PG  - 737-45
LID - 10.1002/da.22531 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Initial studies have provided a mixed perspective of the efficacy of 
      d-cycloserine (DCS) for augmenting the efficacy of exposure-based cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder. In this multicenter trial, we examine 
      the magnitude of DCS augmentation effects for an ultra-brief program of CBT. 
      METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, controlled trial at three treatment sites, 
      randomizing 180 adults with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder to five sessions 
      of treatment, with study pill (50 mg DCS or matching placebo) administered 1 hr 
      prior to the final three sessions. Two booster sessions were subsequently provided, 
      and outcome was assessed at posttreatment and 1-month, 2-month, and 6-month 
      follow-up assessments. The primary outcome was the degree of reduction in the Panic 
      Disorder Severity Scale. Additional analyses examined the role of severity and 
      current antidepressant or benzodiazepine use as moderators of DCS augmentation 
      effects. RESULTS: DCS augmentation resulted in significant benefit only early in the 
      trial, with no beneficial effects of DCS augmentation evident at follow-up 
      evaluations. We did not find that baseline severity or antidepressant or 
      benzodiazepine use moderated DCS efficacy, but benzodiazepine use was associated 
      with lower efficacy of CBT regardless of augmentation condition. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Consistent with other recent multicenter trials, the benefit of DCS was less than 
      indicated by pilot study and reflected an acceleration of treatment response evident 
      at treatment endpoint, but no advantage in response over follow-up evaluation. Our 
      results did not support severity or concomitant medication moderators observed in 
      previous trials of DCS augmentation.

TI  - Benzodiazepine discontinuation difficulties in panic disorder: conceptual model and 
      outcome for cognitive-behavior therapy.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - There is consistent support for the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) to 
      aid the successful discontinuation of benzodiazepine (BZ) medication in patients 
      with panic disorder, and help these individuals maintain treatment gains while off 
      medication. In this article, we provide a conceptual model for BZ discontinuation 
      difficulties in patients with panic disorder. Outcome studies are reviewed, and are 
      placed in the context of other evidence for the efficacy of CBT in patients with 
      this disorder.

TI  - The COMMAND trial of cognitive therapy for harmful compliance with command

      UK.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore service user experiences of a 9-month cognitive behavioural 
      therapy for command hallucinations in the context of a randomised controlled trial 
      including their views on acceptability and tolerability of the intervention. DESIGN: 
      Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. SETTING: The study took place 
      across three sites: Birmingham, Manchester and London. Interviews were carried out 
      at the sites where therapy took place which included service bases and participants' 
      homes. PARTICIPANTS: Of 197 patients who consented to the trial, 98 received the 
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Command Hallucinations (CTCH) intervention; 25 (15 
      males) of whom were randomly selected and consented to the qualitative study. The 
      mean age of the sample was 42 years, and 68% were white British. RESULTS: Two 
      superordinate themes were identified: participants' views about the aspects of CTCH 
      they found most helpful; and participants' concerns with therapy. Helpful aspects of 
      the therapy included gaining control over the voices, challenging the power and 
      omniscience of the voices, following a structured approach, normalisation and 
      mainstreaming of the experience of voices, and having peer support alongside the 
      therapy. Concerns with the therapy included anxiety about completing CTCH tasks, 
      fear of talking back to voices, the need for follow-up and ongoing support and 
      concerns with adaptability of the therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation: CTCH was 
      generally well received and the narratives validated the overall approach. 
      Participants did not find it an easy therapy to undertake as they were challenging a 
      persecutor they believed had great power to harm; many were concerned, anxious and 
      occasionally disappointed that the voices did not disappear altogether. The trusting 
      relationship with the therapist was crucial. The need for continued support was 
      expressed. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN62304114, Pre-results.

TI  - Training clinicians to deliver group CBT to manage anxiety in youth with ASD: 
      Results of a multisite trial.
PG  - 205-217
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000285 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few guidelines are available regarding optimal training models for 
      practitioners delivering cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety in youth 
      with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study systematically compared 3 
      instructional conditions for delivering the Facing Your Fears program (FYF) to 
      children with ASD and anxiety. METHOD: Thirty-four clinicians (Mage = 34 years; 94% 
      women, 88% Caucasian) and an intent-to-treat sample of 91 children with ASD and 
      anxiety (Mage = 11; 84% male 53% Caucasian) met eligibility criteria across 4 sites. 
      A 3-group parallel design via a Latin square procedure was used to randomize 9 teams 
      of clinicians to 1 of 3 training conditions: Manual, Workshop, Workshop-Plus. The 
      effectiveness of instructional condition was assessed via implementation (CBT 
      knowledge, treatment fidelity) and treatment outcomes (reductions in anxiety as 
      measured by the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Parent (ADIS-P). RESULTS: 
      Clinicians in both Workshop conditions significantly increased CBT knowledge 
      postworkshop, F(1, 18) = 19.8, p < .001. Excellent treatment fidelity was obtained 
      across conditions (above 89%), although clinicians in the Workshop conditions 
      obtained significantly higher fidelity ratings and delivered FYF with greater 
      quality than the Manual condition. Children with ASD demonstrated significant 
      reductions in anxiety symptoms for three of the four anxiety diagnoses, with no 
      differences noted across instructional condition. Rates of improvement were lower 
      than those obtained in a previous controlled trial. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest 
      that although there may be some advantage to participating in a Workshop, clinicians 
      in all conditions could deliver FYF with excellent fidelity and yield positive 
      treatment outcomes. Lack of a no-treatment comparison group limits interpretation of 
      findings. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Differential diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder: a medical model perspective.
PG  - 330-41
AB  - The authors present a review of existing literature along with new data regarding 
      the phenomenology, differential diagnosis, course and treatment of panic disorder 
      and agoraphobia. Panic attacks are viewed as central to the development of these 
      disorders, and individual cognitive frameworks contribute to the manner in which a 
      patient's symptoms evolve. An apparent though unclear relation to depressive states 
      is described. Substance abuse may also be a consequence of recurrent panic attacks. 
      A scheme towards differential diagnosis of panic disorder from other psychiatric and 
      medical disorders is proposed. Personality characteristics of these patients vary 
      considerably, but certain factors, such as dependency, are common. Family relations 
      are often strained and assume importance in treatment. Data on the longitudinal 
      course of illness is presented implying a relationship of panic disorder to both 
      depression and stressful life events in many patients. Treatments that thus far seem 
      most effective are pharmacological and behavioural approaches. Imipramine, MAO 
      inhibitors, and alprazolam currently appear to be the most useful medications 
      employed, although other agents may at times be useful alternatives. Dietary 
      interventions, family therapy, and group and individual psychotherapy are also 
      reviewed and discussed as adjunctive therapies in the treatment of panic disorder.

TI  - Predictors and time course of response among panic disorder patients treated with 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy.
PG  - 418-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is well documented as an efficacious 
      treatment for panic disorder. We provided open CBT treatment to patients who 
      subsequently participated in a maintenance treatment study. This article reports on 
      predictors and trajectory of response in 381 participants who completed treatment at 
      4 sites. METHOD: Participants who met criteria for panic disorder with or without 
      agoraphobia (N = 381) completed assessment and entered treatment. Of these, 256 
      completed 11 sessions of CBT delivered by trained and supervised research 
      therapists. Raters trained to reliability obtained demographic data and administered 
      structured diagnostic interviews and the Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and 
      Anxiety and the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) measures at baseline and 
      posttreatment. We obtained self-report (SR) measures of anxiety sensitivity and 
      adult separation anxiety at baseline and posttreatment and PDSS-SR ratings weekly. 
      The study was conducted between November 1999 and July 2002. RESULTS: Treatment 
      response rate was 65.6% for completers and 44.1% for the intent-to-treat sample. 
      Greater severity of panic disorder and lower levels of adult separation anxiety 
      predicted response. Beginning at week 4, responders showed greater mean decreases in 
      PDSS scores than non-responders and maintained the advantage throughout the 
      treatment. By week 6, 76% of responders, compared to 36% of nonresponders, recorded 
      PDSS scores at least 40% below baseline on 2 consecutive weeks (odds ratio = 5.42, 
      95% CI = 3.10 to 9.48). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CBT is just as 
      effective for more severe panic disorder patients as it is for those with less 
      severe panic disorder, regardless of other comorbid disorders, including 
      agoraphobia. However, patients experiencing adult separation anxiety disorder are 
      less likely to respond. Our results further inform clinicians that many people who 
      will respond to 11 weeks of treatment will have done so by the middle of the 
      treatment.

TI  - Using neurobiological measures to predict and assess treatment outcome of 
      psychotherapy in posttraumatic stress disorder: systematic review.
PG  - 142-51
LID - 10.1159/000343258 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) and eye movement 
      desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are effective treatments for posttraumatic 
      stress disorder. However, little is known about their neurobiological effects. The 
      usefulness of neurobiological measures to predict the treatment outcome of 
      psychotherapy also has yet to be determined. METHODS: Systematic review of 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on neurobiological treatment effects of 
      TF-CBT or EMDR and trials with neurobiological measures as predictors of treatment 
      response. RESULTS: We included 23 publications reporting on 16 separate trials. 
      TF-CBT was compared with a waitlist in most trials. TF-CBT was associated with a 
      decrease in heart rate and blood pressure and changes in activity but not in volume 
      of frontal brain structures and the amygdala. Neurobiological changes correlated 
      with changes in symptom severity. EMDR was only tested against other active 
      treatments in included trials. We did not find a difference in neurobiological 
      treatment effects between EMDR and other treatments. Publications on neurobiological 
      predictors of treatment response showed ambiguous results. CONCLUSION: TF-CBT was 
      associated with a reduction of physiological reactivity. There is some preliminary 
      evidence that TF-CBT influences brain regions involved in fear conditioning, 
      extinction learning and possibly working memory and attention regulation; however, 
      these effects could be nonspecific psychotherapeutic effects. Future trials should 
      use paradigms aimed specifically at these brain regions and physiological 
      reactivity. There are concerns regarding the risk of bias in some of the RCTs, 
      indicating that methodologically more rigorous trials are required. Trials with 
      neurobiological measures as predictors of treatment outcome render insufficient 
      results to be useful in clinical practice.

TI  - Predictors of poor treatment response to additional CBT in real panic disorder 
      patients: The role of DLPF, orbitofrontal cortex, parietal lobule, frontal eye field 
      and amygdala in PD.
PG  - 269-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous functional brain imaging studies have described various and 
      contradictory activation findings in patients with panic disorder (PD). Our study 
      focused on patients with a chronic PD, who were investigated and treated in a 
      conventional manner, which represents the real PD patients in clinical practice. 
      METHODS: Continuing their medication, patients were included in a six-week 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program in the psychiatry department. At the 
      onset of the study, participants underwent clinical evaluation using standard scales 
      and were examined using fMRI while listening to verbal threat-related stimuli 
      contrasted to neutral words. According to the therapeutic outcome, they were 
      subsequently divided into two groups, responders, and nonresponders and the two 
      groups were mutually compared. RESULTS: In non-responders compared to responders, we 
      found increased pre-treatment activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      bilaterally, left orbitofrontal cortex, left frontal eye field, right parietal 
      lobule and left amygdala. In addition, both groups showed negative fMRI BOLD 
      correlation with BAI improvement and positive correlation with CGI improvement 
      across the ROIs. We suggest that DLPFC over-activation may reveal a lack of 
      cognitive control over emotional processing, which makes subsequent CBT less 
      effective. CONCLUSION: Despite several limitations, we found neuroimaging predictors 
      of poor CBT response, under the conditions of standard clinical practice, in real PD 
      patients.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), like other illnesses with prominent anxiety, 
      may involve abnormal fear regulation and consolidation of safety memories. Impaired 
      fear extinction memory (extinction recall, ER) has been shown in individuals with 
      current symptoms of OCD [1]. However, contrary to expectations, the only previous 
      study investigating this phenomenon showed a positive correlation between extinction 
      recall abilities and OCD symptomology (i.e., as OCD symptoms worsened, extinction 
      memory improved). The purpose of the current study was to determine if patients with 
      a lifetime diagnosis of OCD (not necessarily currently symptomatic) also demonstrate 
      impairments in extinction memory, and the relationship between OCD symptomology and 
      extinction memory in this type of sample. In addition, we also examined fear 
      renewal, which has never been investigated in an OCD sample. We enrolled 37 patients 
      with OCD, the majority of whom were on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and 18 healthy 
      control participants in a 2-day paradigm assessing fear conditioning and extinction 
      (Day 1) and extinction retention and renewal (Day 2). Skin conductance responses 
      (SCRs) were the dependent measure. Results, as in the prior study, indicated that 
      the only between-group difference was impaired ER in OCD patients relative to 
      controls. Contrary to our prediction, OCD symptom severity was not correlated with 
      the magnitude of extinction recall. There were no differences in fear renewal 
      between OCD patients and controls.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The neural processes underlying the benefits of cognitive behavioral 
      treatment (CBT) for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are not well understood. 
      METHODS: Twenty-one (n=21) adults with a principal diagnosis of GAD and eleven 
      (n=11) non-anxious healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging while completing a facial emotion processing task. Responses to 
      threat-related emotionality (i.e., the contrast of fear and angry vs. happy faces) 
      were assessed at pretreatment and again following 10 sessions of CBT in the GAD 
      group and a comparable waiting period in the HC group. RESULTS: At pretreatment, GAD 
      participants displayed blunted responses in the amygdala, insula, and anterior 
      cingulate to the happy face-processing comparison condition, and greater 
      amygdalo-insular connectivity. CBT was associated with attenuated amygdalar and 
      subgenual anterior cingulate activation to fear/angry faces and heightened insular 
      responses to the happy face comparison condition, but had no apparent effects on 
      connectivity. Pre-treatment abnormalities and treatment-related changes were not 
      associated with symptoms of worry. LIMITATIONS: There was no active control 
      condition (e.g., treatment waitlist) for comparison of treatment effects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results provide evidence for a dual-process 
      psychotherapeutic model of neural systems changes in GAD in which cingulo-amygdalar 
      reactivity to threat-cues is attenuated while insular responses to positive facial 
      emotions are potentiated. Future work is needed to determine the clinical 
      implications of these changes and their specificity to CBT.

AB  - Group-based Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TCBT) for anxiety 
      disorders aims to target common factors to produce beneficial effects on multiple 
      anxiety disorders at once. While there is growing evidence that various anxiety 
      disorders can be effectively treated by this approach, the common factors 
      contributing to these treatment effects are not well delineated. In a sample of 48 
      Veterans who completed Group-based TCBT, the current study examined change in threat 
      perception and change in experiential avoidance pre to post-treatment and as 
      potential mediators of changes in negative affect and personalized fear ratings. 
      Results indicated that both threat perception and experiential avoidance were 
      significantly reduced during treatment. Additionally, reductions in both threat 
      perception and experiential avoidance significantly predicted reductions in negative 
      affect and fear ratings. When change in threat perception and change in experiential 
      avoidance were examined simultaneously, both remained significant predictors of 
      changes in negative affect though only experiential avoidance predicted changes in 
      fear ratings. Thus, both reductions in threat perception and experiential avoidance 
      may mediate the broad treatment effects observed in group-based TCBT. Directions for 
      future research are discussed.

TI  - Prognosis Prediction Using Therapeutic Agreement of Video Conference-Delivered 
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Retrospective Secondary Analysis of a Single-Arm Pilot 
      Trial.
PG  - e15747
LID - 10.2196/15747 [doi]
LID - e15747
AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapist-patient therapeutic alliance is known to be an important 
      factor in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, findings by previous studies 
      for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), and social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD) have not been consistent regarding whether this alliance provides 
      symptomatic improvements. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated predictors of symptom 
      improvement in patients receiving CBT via video conferencing. METHODS: A total of 29 
      patients who participated in a previous clinical trial were recruited for the 
      current study. Therapeutic alliance and clinical background in patients with OCD, 
      PD, and SAD were measured at first session or the eighth session, which were 
      calculated by multiple regression analyses to estimate the impact on therapeutic 
      response percentage change. RESULTS: The multiple regression analyses showed that, 
      among the independent variables, only patients' agreement in the therapeutic 
      alliance remained viable, as other variables were a best fit for the excluded model 
      (P=.002). The results show that patients' agreement on therapeutic goals and tasks 
      explains the prognosis, as the normalization factor beta was 0.54 (SE 32.73; 95% CI 
      1.23-5.17; P=.002) and the adjusted R(2) was .266. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' agreement 
      on therapeutic goals and tasks predicts improvement after CBT via video 
      conferencing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trial Repository

PG  - 1
LID - 10.1186/1753-2000-4-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the design, methods, and rationale of the Child/Adolescent 
      Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), a recently completed federally-funded, multi-site, 
      randomized placebo-controlled trial that examined the relative efficacy of 
      cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), sertraline (SRT), and their combination (COMB) 
      against pill placebo (PBO) for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder (SAD), 
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social phobia (SoP) in children and 
      adolescents. METHODS: Following a brief review of the acute outcomes of the CAMS 
      trial, as well as the psychosocial and pharmacologic treatment literature for 
      pediatric anxiety disorders, the design and methods of the CAMS trial are described. 
      RESULTS: CAMS was a six-year, six-site, randomized controlled trial. Four hundred 
      eighty-eight (N = 488) children and adolescents (ages 7-17 years) with DSM-IV-TR 
      diagnoses of SAD, GAD, or SoP were randomly assigned to one of four treatment 
      conditions: CBT, SRT, COMB, or PBO. Assessments of anxiety symptoms, safety, and 
      functional outcomes, as well as putative mediators and moderators of treatment 
      response were completed in a multi-measure, multi-informant fashion. Manual-based 
      therapies, trained clinicians and independent evaluators were used to ensure 
      treatment and assessment fidelity. A multi-layered administrative structure with 
      representation from all sites facilitated cross-site coordination of the entire 
      trial, study protocols and quality assurance. CONCLUSIONS: CAMS offers a model for 
      clinical trials methods applicable to psychosocial and psychopharmacological 
      comparative treatment trials by using state-of-the-art methods and rigorous 
      cross-site quality controls. CAMS also provided a large-scale examination of the 
      relative and combined efficacy and safety of the best evidenced-based psychosocial 
      (CBT) and pharmacologic (SSRI) treatments to date for the most commonly occurring 
      pediatric anxiety disorders. Primary and secondary results of CAMS will hold 
      important implications for informing practice-relevant decisions regarding the 
      initial treatment of youth with anxiety disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

LID - 10.1002/jclp.22792 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social anxiety increases college student drop-out risk and stifles 
      employment opportunities. Group cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure (CBT ERP) 
      has the potential to alleviate campus resource strain but remains under-researched 
      with college students. The present study investigated the efficacy of group CBT ERP 
      in a randomized clinical trial on a college campus. METHOD: Thirty-one postsecondary 
      students were randomly assigned to an exposure-only group or an active control. 
      RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models indicated significant Group × Time interactions 
      for general social anxiety (t = -2.02, g = 0.62) and depression (t = -2.77, g = 
      0.55); nonsignificant main effects were found for group and time variables. On a 
      measure of fear of negative evaluation, only the main effect of time was significant 
      (t = 2.15, p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: When compared to an active control group, CBT 
      ERP is an efficacious and time-effective treatment for college students experiencing 
      social anxiety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Catastrophic thinking and fear-avoidance belief are negatively 
      influencing severe acute pain following surgery causing delayed ambulation and 
      discharge. We aimed to examine if a preoperative intervention of 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) could influence the early postsurgical outcome 
      following lumbar spinal fusion surgery (LSF). METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing 
      LSF due to degenerative spinal disorders were randomly allocated to either the CBT 
      group or the control group. Both groups received surgery and postoperative 
      rehabilitation. In addition, the CBT group received a preoperative intervention 
      focussed on pain coping using a CBT approach. Primary outcome was back pain during 
      the first week (0-10 scale). Secondary outcomes were mobility, analgesic 
      consumption, and length of hospitalisation. Data were retrieved using self-report 
      questionnaires, assessments made by physical therapists and from medical records. 
      RESULTS: No difference between the groups' self-reported back pain (p = 0.76) was 
      detected. Independent mobility was reached by a significantly larger number of 
      patients in the CBT group than the control group during the first three 
      postoperative days. Analgesic consumption tended to be lower in the CBT group, 
      whereas length of hospitalisation was unaffected by the CBT intervention. 
      CONCLUSION: Participation in a preoperative CBT intervention appeared to facilitate 
      mobility in the acute postoperative phase, despite equally high levels of 
      self-reported acute postsurgical pain in the two groups, and a slightly lower intake 
      of rescue analgesics in the CBT group. This may reflect an overall improved ability 
      to cope with pain following participation in the preoperative CBT intervention. 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Danish Protection Agency 
      (2011-41-5899) and the Ethics Committee of the Central Denmark Region (M-20110047). 
      The trial was registered in Current Controlled Trials ( ISRCTN42281022 ).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness 
      of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and compared the relative effectiveness of 
      individual (ICBT) and group (GCBT) treatment approaches for anxiety disorders in 
      children and adolescents. METHODS: Referred youth (N = 182, M age = 11.5 years, 
      range 8-15 years, 53% girls) with separation anxiety, social phobia, or generalized 
      anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to ICBT, GCBT or a waitlist control (WLC) in 
      community clinics. Pre-, post-, and one year follow-up assessments included youth 
      and parent completed diagnostic interview and symptom measures. After comparing CBT 
      (ICBT and GCBT combined) to WLC, ICBT and GCBT were compared along diagnostic 
      recovery rates, clinically significant improvement, and symptom measures scores 
      using traditional hypothesis tests, as well as statistical equivalence tests. 
      RESULTS: Significantly more youth lost all anxiety disorders after CBT compared to 
      WLC. Full diagnostic recovery rate was 25.3% for ICBT and 20.5% in GCBT, which was 
      not significantly different. There was continued lack of significant differences 
      between ICBT and GCBT at one year follow-up. However, equivalence between GCBT and 
      ICBT could only be demonstrated for clinical severity rating of the principal 
      anxiety disorder and child reported anxiety symptoms post-treatment. CONCLUSION: 
      Findings support the effectiveness of CBT compared to no intervention for youth with 
      anxiety disorders, with no significant differences between ICBT and GCBT. However, 
      the relatively low recovery rates highlight the need for further improvement of CBT 
      programs and their transportability from university to community settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Genes for Treatment study is an international, multisite 
      collaboration exploring the role of genetic, demographic, and clinical predictors in 
      response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in pediatric anxiety disorders. The 
      current article, the first from the study, examined demographic and clinical 
      predictors of response to CBT. We hypothesized that the child's gender, type of 
      anxiety disorder, initial severity and comorbidity, and parents' psychopathology 
      would significantly predict outcome. METHOD: A sample of 1,519 children 5 to 18 
      years of age with a primary anxiety diagnosis received CBT across 11 sites. Outcome 
      was defined as response (change in diagnostic severity) and remission (absence of 
      the primary diagnosis) at each time point (posttreatment, 3-, 6-, and/or 12-month 
      follow-up) and analyzed using linear and logistic mixed models. Separate analyses 
      were conducted using data from posttreatment and follow-up assessments to explore 
      the relative importance of predictors at these time points. RESULTS: Individuals 
      with social anxiety disorder (SoAD) had significantly poorer outcomes (poorer 
      response and lower rates of remission) than those with generalized anxiety disorder 
      (GAD). Although individuals with specific phobia (SP) also had poorer outcomes than 
      those with GAD at posttreatment, these differences were not maintained at follow-up. 
      Both comorbid mood and externalizing disorders significantly predicted poorer 
      outcomes at posttreatment and follow-up, whereas self-reported parental 
      psychopathology had little effect on posttreatment outcomes but significantly 
      predicted response (although not remission) at follow-up. CONCLUSION: SoAD, 
      nonanxiety comorbidity, and parental psychopathology were associated with poorer 
      outcomes after CBT. The results highlight the need for enhanced treatments for 
      children at risk for poorer outcomes.

AB  - Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at high risk for anxiety 
      difficulties and disorders. Clinic-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is 
      effective; however, few published school-based CBT programs for youth with ASD 
      exist. In this study, the Facing Your Fears CBT protocol was adapted for delivery 
      and piloted within a school setting by non-clinicians, with culturally appropriate 
      adaptations. 44 13-15 aged youth with ASD from 22 mainstream schools in Singapore 
      participated. Feasibility, acceptability and preliminary treatment outcomes were 
      examined. Decreases in youth and parent reported anxiety symptoms were reported. 
      Staff and parents found the program useful. Stakeholder support was important for 
      implementation. Initial findings reflect the importance of carefully bridging 
      research-to-practice for youth with ASD and anxiety.

TI  - Design considerations of a randomized clinical trial on a cognitive behavioural 
      intervention using communication and information technologies for managing chronic 
      low back pain.
PG  - 142
LID - 10.1186/1471-2474-14-142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological treatments have been successful in treating chronic low 
      back pain (CLBP). However, the effect sizes are still modest and there is room for 
      improvement. A way to progress is by enhancing treatment adherence and 
      self-management using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Therefore, 
      the objective of this study was to design a trial investigating the short- and 
      long-term efficacy of cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) for CLBP using or not 
      ICTs. A secondary objective of this trial will be to evaluate the influence of 
      relevant variables on treatment response. Possible barriers in the implementation of 
      CBT with and without ICT will also be investigated. METHODS: A randomised controlled 
      trial with 180 CLBP patients recruited from specialised care will be conducted. 
      Participants will be randomly assigned to three conditions: Control group (CG), CBT, 
      and CBT supported by ICTs (CBT + ICT). Participants belonging to the three 
      conditions will receive a conventional rehabilitation program (back school). The CBT 
      group program will last six sessions. The CBT + ICT group will use the internet and 
      SMS to practice the therapeutic strategies between sessions and in the follow-ups at 
      their homes. Primary outcome variables will be self-reported disability and pain 
      intensity. Assessment will be carried out by blinded assessors in five moments: 
      pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. The influence of 
      catastrophizing, fear-avoidance beliefs, anxiety and depression in response to 
      treatment in the primary outcomes will also be analysed. DISCUSSION: This study will 
      show data of the possible benefits of using ICTs in the improvement of CBT for 
      treating CLBP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01802671.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) commonly 
      co-occur in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), yet whether these 
      comorbidities influence the outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD 
      is unclear. METHODS: The present study examined the degree to which individuals with 
      SAD and comorbid MDD (SAD+MDD; n=76), comorbid BD (SAD+BD; n=19), a comorbid anxiety 
      disorder (SAD+ANX; n=27), or no comorbid diagnoses (SAD+NCO; n=41) benefitted from 
      CBT for SAD. Individuals were screened using the Structured Clinical Interview for 
      DSM-IV and then completed the Social Phobia Inventory and the Depression Anxiety 
      Stress Scales before and after 12-weeks of group CBT for SAD. RESULTS: At 
      pretreatment the SAD+MDD and SAD+BD groups reported higher social anxiety symptoms 
      than the SAD+ANX and SAD+NCO groups. All groups reported large and significant 
      improvement in social anxiety with CBT. However, at posttreatment the SAD+MDD and 
      SAD+BD groups continued to have higher social anxiety symptoms than the SAD+NCO 
      group, and the SAD+ANX group did not differ in social anxiety symptoms from any 
      group. The sample also showed small and statistically significant improvement in 
      depressive symptoms with CBT for SAD. LIMITATIONS: Information about medication was 
      not collected in the present study, and we did not assess the long-term effects of 
      CBT. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CBT for SAD is an effective treatment even 
      in the presence of comorbid mood disorders in the short-term, although extending the 
      course of treatment may be helpful for this population and should be investigated in 
      future research.

TI  - Efficacy of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy versus monotherapy in the 
      treatment of anxiety disorders.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - Anxiety disorders in the United States are prevalent, widespread, and disabling. 
      These illnesses may account for almost one third of the $148 billion total mental 
      health bill each year. Pharmacologic options include tricyclic antidepressants, 
      monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anxiolytics. Psychological treatments 
      include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive therapy, exposure, and ritual 
      prevention therapies. Despite insufficient evidence, many experts recommend combined 
      treatment, generally medication with CBT. A literature review was conducted to 
      examine studies with random assignment, adequate methods and sample sizes, blind 
      assessments, sufficient dosages and durations of treatment, and satisfactory 
      reporting of data, to determine whether combined treatment was superior to 
      monotherapy. Twenty-six randomized clinical trials were identified; nine met review 
      criteria. A review of relevant studies could not confirm the superiority of combined 
      treatment over monotherapy. In one of four studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
      combined treatment produced better results than monotherapy. There was no evidence 
      of superiority for combined therapy over monotherapy for the treatment of social 
      phobia or generalized anxiety disorder. There were no studies that met review 
      criteria for either specific phobia or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). With 
      panic disorder, there was evidence that combined treatment might actually lead to 
      worse outcome. Combined treatment is commonly recommended, but empirical support is 
      limited. More research is needed. There are few well-designed studies, and little 
      data regarding PTSD and specific phobias.

TI  - [The effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy in affective and anxiety 
      disorders using functional neuroimaging].
PG  - 167-78
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the last decades psychological studies have demonstrated the 
      effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioural therapy for most anxiety and depressive 
      disorders. Recently, a different and complementary approach in terms of validation 
      of cognitive-behavioural therapy has emerged: testing the efficacy of these 
      therapies using functional neuroimaging techniques. DEVELOPMENT: Neurological 
      studies evaluate the cerebral functioning causing the appearance of symptoms and 
      monitoring the brain activity. In this revision study we show the implications of 
      different brain structures (amygdala, cingulate cortex, thalamus, insula) with the 
      characteristic symptoms of many mental disorders studied (obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder, specific phobia, etc.) and the neurological changes after applying a 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy. CONCLUSIONS: At the present there is a very limited 
      number of studies due to the complexity in implementing this type of researches. 
      However, data suggest changes in metabolic activity after cognitive-behavioural 
      therapy at the same time as the decrease of symptoms. Future studies should control 
      the influence of variables such as comorbidity and medication, which prevent more 
      definitive conclusions.

TI  - Modes of Large-Scale Brain Network Organization during Threat Processing and 
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Reduction during TF-CBT among Adolescent 
      Girls.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often chronic and disabling across the 
      lifespan. The gold standard treatment for adolescent PTSD is Trauma-Focused 
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), though treatment response is variable and 
      mediating neural mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we test whether PTSD 
      symptom reduction during TF-CBT is associated with individual differences in 
      large-scale brain network organization during emotion processing. Twenty adolescent 
      girls, aged 11-16, with PTSD related to assaultive violence completed a 12-session 
      protocol of TF-CBT. Participants completed an emotion processing task, in which 
      neutral and fearful facial expressions were presented either overtly or covertly 
      during 3T fMRI, before and after treatment. Analyses focused on characterizing 
      network properties of modularity, assortativity, and global efficiency within an 824 
      region-of-interest brain parcellation separately during each of the task blocks 
      using weighted functional connectivity matrices. We similarly analyzed an existing 
      dataset of healthy adolescent girls undergoing an identical emotion processing task 
      to characterize normative network organization. Pre-treatment individual differences 
      in modularity, assortativity, and global efficiency during covert fear vs neutral 
      blocks predicted PTSD symptom reduction. Patients who responded better to treatment 
      had greater network modularity and assortativity but lesser efficiency, a pattern 
      that closely resembled the control participants. At a group level, greater symptom 
      reduction was associated with greater pre-to-post-treatment increases in network 
      assortativity and modularity, but this was more pronounced among participants with 
      less symptom improvement. The results support the hypothesis that modularized and 
      resilient brain organization during emotion processing operate as mechanisms 
      enabling symptom reduction during TF-CBT.

AB  - A substantial number of children with anxiety disorders do not improve following 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Recent effectiveness studies have found poorer 
      outcome for CBT programs than what is typically found in efficacy studies. The 
      present study examined predictors of treatment outcome among 181 children (aged 8-15 
      years), with separation anxiety, social phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder, who 
      participated in a randomized, controlled effectiveness trial of a 10-session CBT 
      program in community clinics. Potential predictors included baseline demographic, 
      child, and parent factors. Outcomes were as follows: a) remission from all inclusion 
      anxiety disorders; b) remission from the primary anxiety disorder; and c) child- and 
      parent-rated reduction of anxiety symptoms at post-treatment and at 1-year 
      follow-up. The most consistent findings across outcome measures and informants were 
      that child-rated anxiety symptoms, functional impairment, a primary diagnosis of 
      social phobia or separation anxiety disorder, and parent internalizing symptoms 
      predicted poorer outcome at post-treatment. Child-rated anxiety symptoms, lower 
      family social class, lower pretreatment child motivation, and parent internalizing 
      symptoms predicted poorer outcome at 1-year follow-up. These results suggest that 
      anxious children with more severe problems, and children of parents with elevated 
      internalizing symptom levels, may be in need of modified, additional, or alternative 
      interventions to achieve a positive treatment outcome.

TI  - Mechanisms of efficacy of CBT for Cambodian refugees with PTSD: improvement in

AB  - Based on the results of a randomized controlled trial, we examined a model of the 
      mechanisms of efficacy of culturally adapted cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for 
      Cambodian refugees with pharmacology-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
      and comordid orthostatic panic attacks (PAs). Twelve patients were in the initial 
      treatment condition, 12 in the delayed treatment condition. The patients randomized 
      to CBT had much greater improvement than patients in the waitlist condition on all 
      psychometric measures and on one physiological measure-the systolic blood pressure 
      response to orthostasis (d = 1.31)-as evaluated by repeated-measures MANOVA and 
      planned contrasts. After receiving CBT, the Delayed Treatment Group improved on all 
      measures, including the systolic blood pressure response to orthostasis. The CBT 
      treatment's reduction of PTSD severity was significantly mediated by improvement in 
      orthostatic panic and emotion regulation ability. The current study supports our 
      model of the generation of PTSD in the Cambodian population, and suggests a key role 
      of decreased vagal tone in the generation of orthostatic panic and PTSD in this 
      population. It also suggests that vagal tone is involved in emotion regulation, and 
      that both vagal tone and emotion regulation improve across treatment.

PG  - 171-83

AB  - Pediatric generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and 
      uncontrollable worry about a variety of events and is accompanied by physical 
      symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, and 
      heart palpitations. Symptoms impose marked distress and interfere with social, 
      emotional, and educational functioning. GAD occurs in over 10% of children and 
      adolescents, has an average age of onset of 8.5 years, and is more often reported in 
      girls. Common co-occurring conditions include separation anxiety disorder and social 
      phobia. Assessment involves a multi-informant, multi-method approach involving the 
      child, parents, and school teachers. A clinical interview should be conducted to 
      assess for the three primary ways anxiety presents: behaviors, thoughts, and somatic 
      symptoms. Several semi-structured diagnostic interviews are available, and the 
      Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule is increasingly used. Rating scales completed 
      by the patient, caregivers, and teachers provide useful information for diagnosis 
      and symptom monitoring. Several scales are available to assess patients for the 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition) GAD diagnosis; 
      however, instruments generally cannot distinguish children with GAD from children 
      with similar anxiety disorders. Both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have demonstrated efficacy for the 
      treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders including GAD. Evidence suggests that the 
      combination of CBT plus sertraline offers additional benefit compared with either 
      treatment alone. With pharmacotherapy, systematic tracking of treatment-emergent 
      adverse events such as headaches, stomach aches, behavioral activation, worsening 
      symptoms, and emerging suicidal thoughts is important. Recommended starting doses 
      are fluvoxamine 25 mg/day, fluoxetine 10 mg/day, and sertraline 25 mg/day, though 
      lower starting doses are possible. Dosing can be adjusted as often as weekly with 
      the goal of achieving a high-quality response, while minimizing side effects. 
      Long-term treatment with medication has not been well studied; however, to achieve 
      optimal long-term outcome extended use of medication may be required. It is 
      recommended to continue medication for approximately 1 year following remission in 
      symptoms, and when discontinuing medication to choose a stress-free time of the 
      year. If symptoms return, medication re-initiation should be considered seriously.

PG  - 719-35
AB  - The anxiety disorders discussed in this article are common, affecting 5% to 10% of 
      the general population. They may cause significant distress and disability and are 
      often complicated by substance abuse and depression. Fortunately, these disorders 
      can be treated successfully in the majority of patients, with alleviation of the 
      most distressing symptoms and significant improvement in occupational and social 
      functioning. Systematic research studies during the past decade have identified both 
      specific medication-responsive anxiety syndromes and a variety of 
      psychopharmacologic agents effective in their management. Psychopharmacologic 
      treatment, often in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapies, can be tailored 
      for the individual patient based on that patient's specific anxiety syndrome, 
      comorbid disorders, and vulnerability to side effects. Careful monitoring of target 
      symptoms can be used to assess the efficacy of treatment. Future research will help 
      to develop new classes of antianxiety agents for currently treatment-resistant 
      patients, and to investigate further the necessary duration of psychopharmacologic 
      treatment.

      adolescents with intellectual disability.
PG  - 919-932
LID - 10.1002/jclp.22741 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the feasibility of the Fearless Me! program, an 
      online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for children with intellectual 
      disability (ID) and anxiety. METHOD: Twenty-one adolescents with mild to moderate ID 
      participated in ten sessions of the therapist-assisted Fearless Me! program, 
      combining face-to-face group sessions and an online component. A case series design 
      was adopted to assess anxiety symptoms at baseline, throughout intervention, and 
      postintervention. Feasibility of the measures, intervention, and trial design were 
      considered. RESULTS: The measures were appropriate and sensitive to changes in 
      anxiety, whereas the need for attention to factors influencing parent's completion 
      of them was identified. Reliable Change Index and visual analyses of results 
      indicated reductions in anxiety, particularly for older adolescents with heightened 
      levels of anxiety at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first CBT programs 
      for adolescents with ID, and provides preliminary evidence of adapted CBT as a 
      feasible treatment.

LID - 10.2147/NDT.S41365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common psychiatric 
      disorders worldwide. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment 
      option for patients with SAD. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of 
      group CBT for patients with generalized SAD in Japan at 1-year follow-up and 
      investigated predictors with regard to outcomes. METHODS: This study was conducted 
      as a single-arm, naturalistic, follow-up study in a routine Japanese clinical 
      setting. A total of 113 outpatients with generalized SAD participated in group CBT 
      from July 2003 to August 2010 and were assessed at follow-ups for up to 1 year. 
      Primary outcome was the total score on the Social Phobia Scale/Social Interaction 
      Anxiety Scale (SPS/SIAS) at 1 year. Possible baseline predictors were investigated 
      using mixed-model analyses. RESULTS: Among the 113 patients, 70 completed the 
      assessment at the 1-year follow-up. The SPS/SIAS scores showed significant 
      improvement throughout the follow-ups for up to 1 year. The effect sizes of SPS/SIAS 
      at the 1-year follow-up were 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.95)/0.76 
      (0.49-1.03) in the intention-to-treat group and 0.77 (0.42-1.10)/0.84 (0.49-1.18) in 
      completers. Older age at baseline, late onset, and lower severity of SAD were 
      significantly associated with good outcomes as a result of mixed-model analyses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CBT for patients with generalized SAD in Japan is effective for up to 1 
      year after treatment. The effect sizes were as large as those in previous studies 
      conducted in Western countries. Older age at baseline, late onset, and lower 
      severity of SAD were predictors for a good outcome from group CBT.

TI  - Anxiety, panic and adult asthma: a cognitive-behavioral perspective.
PG  - 194-202
AB  - A review of previous research suggests increased probability of the prevalence of 
      anxiety disorders, and particularly panic disorder and panic attacks in patients 
      with asthma, as compared to a normal population. Research also indicates significant 
      levels of co-morbidity between asthma and anxiety as measured on dimensional scales 
      of anxiety and panic. Clinical anxiety and panic manifestations affect symptom 
      perception and asthma management through the effects of anxiety symptoms such as 
      hyperventilation, and indirectly through self-management behavior and physician 
      response. However, there is limited data on the impact of anxiety co-morbidity on 
      asthma quality of life. Some studies indicate that individuals with co-morbid asthma 
      and anxiety or panic report worse asthma quality of life both in general and in 
      relation to their symptomatology, being limited in their daily activities, in 
      response to environmental stimuli and in regard to feelings of emotional distress. 
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective and empirically supported 
      treatment of choice for anxiety disorders and panic attacks. However, standard CBT 
      protocols for anxiety and panic may need to be specifically targeted at improving 
      asthma outcomes. Also, asthma research literature is lacking in randomized 
      controlled trials applying CBT to patients with co-morbid asthma and clinical 
      anxiety manifestations. Trials evaluating CBT interventions in individuals with 
      clinical anxiety manifestations and asthma may provide evidence of these 
      interventions as an effective adjunct to improve asthma management and control.

TI  - A model of the generation of ataque de nervios: the role of fear of negative affect 
      and fear of arousal symptoms.
PG  - 264-75
LID - 10.1111/j.1755-5949.2009.00101.x [doi]
AB  - This article examines a model of the generation of ataque de nervios, according to 
      which both fear of negative affectivity and fear of arousal symptoms are associated 
      with the emergence of ataques. We examine the relationship of fear of negative 
      affectivity and fear of arousal to the severity of ataque de nervios during the last 
      month and the last 6 months among Caribbean Latinos residing in the United States. 
      The measures include a Fear of Anger Scale and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), 
      the ASI augmented with two items that assess fear of arousal symptoms common in 
      ataques: chest tightness and a sense of inner heat. In keeping with the model of 
      ataque generation, one-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) and discriminant function 
      analyses illustrated that items assessing "fear of negative affect" and "fear of 
      somatic and psychological symptoms of arousal" both differentiated well among the 
      levels of ataque severity. In addition, key ataque symptoms-mental incapacitation 
      fears, shakiness, chest tightness, palpitations, and a sense of inner heat-were the 
      best discriminators among levels of ataque severity. In patients with severe 
      ataques, the scores of "fear of negative affect" and "fear of ataque-de-nervios-type 
      somatic and psychological symptoms" were extremely elevated. This further suggests 
      that both these types of fears are associated with this idiom of distress and that 
      the specific content of the fears is linked to the symptom picture of the idiom. 
      This suggests specific therapeutic targets for the treatment of ataque, namely, the 
      reduction of anxiety sensitivity (and more generally negative-emotion and arousal 
      sensitivity) using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation, and mindfulness 
      techniques.

TI  - [Virtual reality exposure therapy for post-traumatic stress disorders, 
      obsessive-compulsive disorders and anxiety disorders: Indications, added value and 
      limitations].

AB  - The exposure in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-known intervention, 
      widely investigated in scientific research. Several studies have shown the benefits 
      of this intervention in the treatment of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive 
      disorders (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The different exposure 
      techniques are mainly based on the emotional processing of fear theory and use an 
      emotional stimulation of fear, following by its habituation. However, new approaches 
      have emerged and are based on the inhibitory learning theory. The virtual reality 
      technology allows emotional involvement from patients and represents a complementary 
      approach to the classical modalities of exposure therapy (e.g., mental or in vivo 
      expositions). This modern approach presents specific features that need to be taken 
      into account by the therapist. Firstly, the presence feeling, which is defined as 
      the "be there" feeling. This feeling is dependent on immersive technical features 
      and personality factors. Secondly, virtual reality sickness, similar to motion 
      sickness, represents a limitation that might prejudice a virtual therapy. The main 
      scientific investigations of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) for treating 
      social phobia, specific phobia, PTSD, and panic disorders are encouraging and 
      demonstrate a similar effectiveness between both in vivo and in virtuo exposures. 
      The scarce investigations on generalized anxiety disorders and OCD also suggeste a 
      similar effectiveness between these exposures. However, further scientific 
      investigations are needed to support these preliminary findings. The attrition rates 
      and deteriorating states are similar to classical CBT approaches. Nevertheless, 
      scientific literature presents several limits: 1) much of the research on this topic 
      has interest conflicts (e.g., developers are also authors of a large number of 
      studies); 2) there is a high heterogeneity of materials and virtual environments 
      used; 3) important measures are not always taken into account in scientific research 
      (e.g., the presence feeling); and 4) a massive use of waiting lists as a control 
      measure. Despite these limitations, the VRET have strong silver linings: 1) the easy 
      access to exposure (less limited than standard exposure techniques) and a cost 
      reduction; 2) highly guaranteed security; 3) the anonymization of exposures (i.e., 
      the patients do not risk meeting someone they know during the exposure therapy); 4) 
      the therapist has a greater control of exposures; 5) a standardization of the 
      exposures; 6) a greater involvement in therapy for technophile patients. Virtual 
      exposure also seems to be generally more accepted by patients.

PG  - 251-8
LID - 10.1002/da.20533 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder (PD) patients have been shown to have reduced heart rate 
      variability (HRV). Low HRV has been associated with elevated risk for cardiovascular 
      disease. Our aim was to investigate the effects of treatment on heart rate (HR) in 
      patients with PD through a hyperventilation challenge. METHODS: We studied 54 
      participants, 43 with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) 
      PD and 11 controls. Subjects lay supine with their heads in a plastic canopy 
      chamber, resting for 15 min and then breathing at a rate of 30 breaths per minute 
      for 10 min. HRV was sampled for spectral analysis. Clinical and behavioral measures 
      of anxiety were assessed. Treatment was chosen by patients: either 12 weeks of CBT 
      alone or CBT with sertraline. RESULTS: All patients showed significant decrease on 
      clinical measures from baseline and 31 were treatment responders, 8 dropped out of 
      the study before completion of the 12-week treatment phase and 4 were deemed 
      nonresponders after 12 weeks of treatment. Although both treatments led to 
      significant clinical improvement, only CBT alone demonstrated a significant 
      reduction in HR and increase in HRV. CONCLUSIONS: Our study replicated the finding 
      that increased HR and decreased HRV occur in PD patients. Given the evidence of 
      cardiac risk related to HRV, CBT appears to have additional benefits beyond symptom 
      reduction. The mechanisms of this difference between CBT and sertraline are unclear 
      and require further study.

TI  - Assessing fidelity of cognitive behavioral therapy in rural VA clinics: design of a 
      randomized implementation effectiveness (hybrid type III) trial.
PG  - 65
LID - 10.1186/s13012-016-0432-4 [doi]
LID - 65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Broadly disseminating and implementing evidence-based psychotherapies 
      with high fidelity, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), has proved 
      challenging for many health-care systems, including the Department of Veterans 
      Affairs, especially in primary care settings such as small or remote clinics. A 
      computer-based tool (based on the coordinated anxiety learning and management (CALM) 
      program) was designed to support primary care-based mental health providers in 
      delivering CBT. The objectives of this study are to modify the CALM tool to meet the 
      needs of mental health clinicians in veterans affairs (VA) community-based 
      outpatient clinics (CBOCs) and rural "veterans", use external facilitation to 
      implement CBT and determine the effect of the CALM tool versus a manualized version 
      of CALM to improve fidelity to the CBT treatment model, and conduct a needs 
      assessment to understand how best to support future implementation of the CALM tool 
      in routine care. METHODS/DESIGN: Focus groups will inform the redesign of the CALM 
      tool. Mental health providers at regional VA CBOCs; CBT experts; VA experts in 
      implementation of evidence-based mental health practices; and veterans with 
      generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic 
      stress disorder, "with or without" depression will be recruited. A hybrid type III 
      design will be used to examine the effect of receiving CBT training plus either the 
      CALM tool or a manual version of CALM on treatment fidelity. External facilitation 
      will be used as the overarching strategy to implement both CBT delivery methods. 
      Data will also be collected on symptoms of the targeted disorders. To help prepare 
      for the future implementation of the CALM tool in VA CBOCs, we will perform an 
      implementation need assessment with mental health providers participating in the 
      clinical trial and their CBOC directors. DISCUSSION: This project will help inform 
      strategies for delivering CBT with high fidelity in VA CBOCs to veterans with 
      anxiety disorders and PTSD with or without depression. If successful, results of 
      this study could be used to inform a national rollout of the CALM tool in VA CBOCs 
      including providing recommendations for optimizing the adoption and sustained use of 
      the computerized CALM tool among mental health providers in this setting. TRIAL

LID - 10.1016/j.beth.2010.10.002 [doi]
AB  - The current study examined utilization of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) by 
      individuals receiving treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). 
      Participants were 202 adults with primary DSM-IV OCD who enrolled in a longitudinal, 
      observational study of the course of OCD and completed 2 years of annual follow-up 
      interviews using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. One hundred twenty 
      participants reported that a mental health professional recommended CBT for their 
      OCD symptoms at some point during the 2-year follow-up period. One quarter (n = 31) 
      of these participants did not initiate CBT despite receiving a treatment 
      recommendation. Thirty-one percent of the 89 participants who entered CBT endorsed 
      dropping out of CBT prematurely and less than one third received an adequate "dose" 
      of CBT sessions. Self-reported CBT drop-out rates were significantly greater than 
      attrition rates reported in clinical trials using intensive schedules of exposure 
      and ritual prevention (EX/RP). Perceived environmental barriers and fears regarding 
      treatment participation were the most frequently endorsed reasons for not 
      participating or dropping out of CBT. Despite its efficacy for OCD, many individuals 
      with clinically significant symptoms fail to initiate CBT when recommended by a 
      mental health professional, receive treatments that are less intensive than those 
      used in clinical trials, or drop out of treatment prematurely. Financial costs of 
      CBT, difficulty attending sessions, and fears regarding treatment are significant 
      barriers to initiating and completing therapy.

TI  - Early intervention for subthreshold panic disorder in the Netherlands: A model-based 
      economic evaluation from a societal perspective.
PG  - e0193338
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0193338 [doi]
LID - e0193338
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder (PD) is associated with impaired functioning and reduced 
      quality of life. In the Netherlands, almost 2% of the population experiences 
      clinically relevant panic symptoms without meeting the diagnostic criteria for PD, 
      which is referred to as subthreshold PD (STHPD). Evidence suggests that subthreshold 
      mental disorders may have a similar impact on quality of life and functioning in 
      comparison with full-blown mental disorders, which draws attention to the need for 
      interventions for STHPD. These interventions are currently not systematically 
      provided in clinical practice. This study aims to investigate the population 
      cost-effectiveness of adding a CBT-based early intervention for adults with STHPD to 
      the existing health care for people with PD in the Netherlands. METHODS: A 
      health-economic Markov model was constructed in order to compare quality adjusted 
      life-years (QALYs) and societal costs of adding an early intervention to usual care 
      for PD. The model compares usual care with an alternative program in which usual 
      care is supplemented with a CBT-based early intervention. Input parameters for the 
      model were derived from national sources and published literature where possible, 
      and based on expert opinion otherwise. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity 
      analyses were conducted to evaluate the uncertainty of the model input parameters. 
      RESULTS: On average, the added CBT-based early intervention was dominant in 
      comparison with usual care, meaning that the early intervention yielded more QALYs 
      at lower costs. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY, the 
      cost-effectiveness probability of the added early intervention was 98%. Sensitivity 
      analyses showed that the results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 
      offering an early intervention in addition to usual care for PD is potentially 
      cost-effective, but it should be further investigated to what extent trial results 
      can be extrapolated to the level of the population before such interventions are 
      implemented on a large scale.

TI  - A brief cognitive-behavioral intervention for treating depression and panic disorder 
      in patients with noncardiac chest pain: a 24-week randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 670-8
LID - 10.1002/da.22106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with noncardiac chest pain experience anxiety and 
      depressive symptoms. Commonly they are reassured and referred back to primary care, 
      leaving them undiagnosed and untreated. Some small studies have suggested efficacy 
      of 12 cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions. Our aim was to examine efficacy 
      of brief CBT in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with noncardiac 
      chest pain and comorbid panic and/or depressive disorders. METHODS: In this 24-week 
      randomized controlled trial comparing CBT (n = 60) versus treatment as usual (TAU, n 
      = 53), we included all adults who presented at the cardiac emergency unit of a 
      university hospital with noncardiac chest pain, scored ≥8 on the hospital anxiety 
      and depression scale (HADS) and were diagnosed with a comorbid panic and/or 
      depressive disorder with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. CBT 
      consisted of six individual sessions. Main outcome was disease severity assessed 
      with the clinical global inventory (CGI) by a blinded independent rater. RESULTS: 
      ANCOVA in the intention-to-treat and completer sample showed that CBT was superior 
      to TAU after 24 weeks in reducing disease severity assessed with CGI (P < .001). 
      Secondary outcomes on anxiety (HADS-anxiety, state trait anxiety inventory 
      (STAI)-trait) and depressive symptoms (Hamilton depression rating scale) were in 
      line with these results except for HADS-depression (P = .10), fear questionnaire (P 
      = .13), and STAI-state (P = .11). CONCLUSIONS: Brief CBT significantly reduces 
      anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with noncardiac chest pain who are 
      diagnosed with panic and/or depressive disorders. Patients presenting with 
      noncardiac chest pain should be screened for psychopathology and if positive, CBT 
      should be considered.

AB  - This article provides a brief review of the current available data concerning 
      present treatment and potential new treatment advances for pediatric anxiety 
      disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social 
      phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. 
      Disorder-specific treatment methods and innovations, particularly computer-assisted 
      methods of delivery for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) will be reviewed. 
      Additionally, the paper will discuss novel psychopharmacological compounds (e.g., 
      D-cycloserine, riluzole, memantine, and anticonvulsant medications). Available 
      evidence for the efficacy of novel medication strategies in adult studies and 
      implications for their use in pediatrics will be discussed.

AB  - Nearly one-third of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) fail to 
      respond to adequate therapeutic approaches such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This study investigated structural 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates as potential pre-treatment brain markers 
      to predict treatment response in treatment-naïve OCD patients randomized between 
      trials of fluoxetine or CBT. Treatment-naïve OCD patients underwent structural MRI 
      scans before randomization to a 12-week clinical trial of either fluoxetine or 
      group-based CBT. Voxel-based morphometry was used to identify correlations between 
      pretreatment regional gray matter volume and changes in symptom severity on the 
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Brain regional correlations of 
      treatment response differed between treatment groups. Notably, symptom improvement 
      in the fluoxetine treatment group (n=14) was significantly correlated with smaller 
      pretreatment gray matter volume within the right middle lateral orbitofrontal cortex 
      (OFC), whereas symptom improvement in the CBT treatment group (n=15) was 
      significantly correlated with larger pretreatment gray matter volume within the 
      right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). No significant a priori regional correlations 
      of treatment response were identified as common between the two treatment groups 
      when considering the entire sample (n=29). These findings suggest that pretreatment 
      gray matter volumes of distinct brain regions within the lateral OFC and mPFC were 
      differentially correlated to treatment response to fluoxetine versus CBT in OCD 
      patients. This study further implicates the mPFC in the fear/anxiety extinction 
      process and stresses the importance of lateral portions of the OFC in mediating 
      fluoxetine's effectiveness in OCD. Clinical registration information:

TI  - Resting state amygdala-prefrontal connectivity predicts symptom change after 
      cognitive behavioral therapy in generalized social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 14

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aberrant amygdala-prefrontal interactions at rest and during emotion 
      processing are implicated in the pathophysiology of generalized social anxiety 
      disorder (gSAD), a common disorder characterized by fears of potential scrutiny. 
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is first-line psychotherapy for gSAD and other 
      anxiety disorders. While CBT is generally effective, there is a great deal of 
      heterogeneity in treatment response. To date, predictors of success in CBT for gSAD 
      include reduced amygdala reactivity and increased activity in prefrontal regulatory 
      regions (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, "ACC") during emotion processing. However, 
      studies have not examined whether tonic (i.e., at rest) coupling of amygdala and 
      these prefrontal regions also predict response to CBT. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients 
      with gSAD participated in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      before 12 weeks of CBT. Overall, symptom severity was significantly reduced after 
      completing CBT; however, the patients varied considerably in degree of symptom 
      change. Whole-brain voxel-wise findings showed symptom improvement after CBT was 
      predicted by greater right amygdala-pregenual ACC ("pgACC") connectivity and greater 
      left amygdala-pgACC coupling encompassing medial prefrontal cortex. In support of 
      their predictive value, area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 
      significant for the left and right amygdala-pgACC in relation to treatment 
      responders. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement after CBT was predicted by enhanced 
      resting-state bilateral amygdala-prefrontal coupling in gSAD. Preliminary results 
      suggest baseline individual differences in a fundamental circuitry that may underlie 
      emotion regulation contributed to variation in symptom change after CBT. Findings 
      offer a new approach towards using a biological measure to foretell who will most 
      likely benefit from CBT. In particular, the departure from neural predictors based 
      on illness-relevant stimuli (e.g., socio-emotional stimuli in gSAD) permits the 
      development of biomarkers that reflect commonalities in the neurobiology of anxiety 
      and mood disorders.

TI  - Group cognitive behavioural therapy for schizophrenia: a systematic review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 673-81
AB  - There are a growing number of studies which have evaluated group-based cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBGT) for individuals with psychosis. This is at least partly 
      driven by the need to maximize access to this evidence-based treatment which has 
      still to be widely disseminated. In this paper we present a systematic review of 
      trials which have evaluated the efficacy CBGT. Five controlled trials were 
      identified, the results showed some improvements in specific areas of symptomatology 
      such as social phobia and depression. However, methodological weaknesses of the 
      studies compromised the confidence with which a cause and effect relationship can be 
      established. CBGT may enable a greater number of individuals to be seen by a small 
      group of trained therapists but whether this is an effective treatment remains to be 
      established. In addition, whether therapists delivering cognitive behavioural 
      therapy in a group format require a higher level of skill than those facilitating 
      the intervention on an individual basis remains an empirical question. The finding 
      that a short psycho-education group treatment reduced positive and negative symptoms 
      is also worthy of further investigation given the difficulties reported in 
      disseminating evidence-based psychosocial interventions for this client group.

TI  - Stepped care for depression and anxiety in visually impaired older adults: 
      multicentre randomised controlled trial.
PG  - h6127
LID - 10.1136/bmj.h6127 [doi]
LID - h6127
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Is stepped care compared with usual care effective in preventing the 
      onset of major depressive, dysthymic, and anxiety disorders in older people with 
      visual impairment (caused mainly by age related eye disease) and subthreshold 
      depression and/or anxiety? METHODS: 265 people aged ≥50 were randomly assigned to a 
      stepped care programme plus usual care (n=131) or usual care only (n=134). 
      Supervised occupational therapists, social workers, and psychologists from low 
      vision rehabilitation organisations delivered the stepped care programme, which 
      comprised watchful waiting, guided self help based on cognitive behavioural therapy, 
      problem solving treatment, and referral to a general practitioner. The primary 
      outcome was the 24 month cumulative incidence (seven measurements) of major 
      depressive dysthymic and/or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social 
      phobia, and generalised anxiety disorder). Secondary outcomes were change in 
      symptoms of depression and anxiety, vision related quality of life, health related 
      quality of life, and adaptation to vision loss over time up to 24 months' follow-up. 
      STUDY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS: 62 participants (46%) in the usual care group and 38 
      participants (29%) from the stepped care group developed a disorder. The 
      intervention was associated with a significantly reduced incidence (relative risk 
      0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.87; P=0.01), even if time to the event was 
      taken into account (adjusted hazard ratio 0.57, 0.35 to 0.93; P=0.02). The number 
      needed to treat was 5.8 (3.5 to 17.3). The dropout rate was fairly high (34.3%), but 
      rates were not significantly different for the two groups, indicating that the 
      intervention was as acceptable as usual care. Participants who volunteered and were 
      selected for this study might not be representative of visually impaired older 
      adults in general (responders were significantly younger than non-responders), 
      thereby reducing the generalisability of the outcomes. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Stepped 
      care seems to be a promising way to deal with depression and anxiety in visually 
      impaired older adults. This approach could lead to standardised strategies for the 
      screening, monitoring, treatment, and referral of visually impaired older adults 
      with depression and anxiety. FUNDING, COMPETING INTERESTS, DATA SHARING: Funded by

TI  - D-Cycloserine vs Placebo as Adjunct to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Interaction With Antidepressants: A Randomized 
      Clinical Trial.
PG  - 659-67
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0546 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: It is unclear whether d-cycloserine (DCS), a partial 
      N-methyl-d-aspartate agonist that enhances fear extinction, can augment the effects 
      of exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder (OCD). OBJECTIVES: To examine whether DCS augments the effects of CBT for 
      OCD and to explore (post hoc) whether concomitant antidepressant medication 
      moderates the effects of DCS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 12-week, 
      double-blind randomized clinical trial with 3-month follow-up conducted at an 
      academic medical center between September 4, 2012, and September 26, 2013. 
      Participants included 128 adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of OCD and a 
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score of 16 or higher. Concurrent 
      antidepressant medication was permitted if the dose had been stable for at least 2 
      months prior to enrollment and remained unchanged during the trial. The main 
      analysis was by intention-to-treat population. INTERVENTIONS: All participants 
      received a previously validated Internet-based CBT protocol over 12 weeks and were 
      randomized to receive either 50 mg of DCS or placebo, administered 1 hour before 
      each of 5 exposure and response prevention tasks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Clinician-administered Y-BOCS score at week 12 and at 3-month follow-up. Remission 
      was defined as a score of 12 or lower on the Y-BOCS. RESULTS: In the primary 
      intention-to-treat analyses, DCS did not augment the effects of CBT compared with 
      placebo (mean [SD] clinician-rated Y-BOCS score, DCS: 13.86 [6.50] at week 12 and 
      12.35 [7.75] at 3-month follow-up; placebo: 11.77 [5.95] at week 12 and 12.37 [6.68] 
      at 3-month follow-up) but showed a significant interaction with antidepressants 
      (clinician-rated Y-BOCS, B = -1.08; Z = -2.79; P = .005). Post hoc analyses revealed 
      that antidepressants significantly impaired treatment response in the DCS group but 
      not the placebo group, at both posttreatment and follow-up (clinician-rated Y-BOCS: 
      t62 = -3.00; P = .004; and t61 = -3.49; P < .001, respectively). In the DCS group, a 
      significantly greater proportion of antidepressant-free patients achieved remission 
      status at follow-up (60% [95% CI, 45%-74%]) than antidepressant-medicated patients 
      (24% [95% CI, 9%-48%]) (P = .008). Antidepressants had no effect in the placebo 
      group (50% [95% CI, 36%-64%] remission rate in both groups). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that antidepressants may interact with DCS to block 
      its facilitating effect on fear extinction. Use of DCS may be a promising CBT 
      augmentation strategy but only in antidepressant-free patients with OCD. TRIAL

TI  - Treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia in an anxiety disorders clinic: factors 
      influencing psychiatrists' treatment choices.
PG  - 41-52
AB  - The main objective of this report was to identify patient characteristics that led 
      psychiatrists in an academic anxiety disorders clinic to make a decision about 
      intensive treatment of patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) with 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) alone, CBT plus a high-potency benzodiazepine 
      (CBT+BZ) or CBT combined with BZ and an antidepressant, fluoxetine (CBT+BZ+AD). On 
      the basis of their clinical judgment and collaborative negotiation with the patient, 
      psychiatrists chose one of the three treatment modalities for 102 PDA outpatients. 
      Two stepwise logistic regressions were performed to explore pre-treatment patient 
      characteristics the psychiatrists may have considered in choosing among these 
      treatments. One regression examined the decision to add BZ to CBT, while the other 
      examined the decision to add AD to CBT+BZ. Psychiatrists generally used combination 
      treatments in patients with more severe PDA. CBT alone was a more likely choice for 
      dominant anxiety-related cognitive phenomena. Patients with prominent panic attacks 
      and somatic symptoms were more likely to be treated with CBT+BZ, while those who 
      also had significant depressive symptoms and higher disability levels were more 
      likely to receive CBT+BZ+AD. Patients in all three treatment groups showed 
      significant reduction in symptoms during intensive treatment and reached similar end 
      states. In a clinic setting where CBT is accepted as the basic treatment for PDA, 
      psychiatrists added BZ to control prominent panic symptoms and added AD to elevate 
      depressed mood and help cope with marked disability. These choices appear rational 
      and resulted in substantial clinical improvement at the end of intensive treatment 
      in the clinic.

TI  - [Analysis of the cost and the effectiveness of a psychotherapy for panic disorder 
      with agoraphobia (PDA) versus a treatment combining pharmacotherapy and 
      psychotherapy].
PG  - 201-20
AB  - Pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are efficient treatments for 
      Panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) yet they remain expensive. This study aims to 
      compare the cost/effectiveness ratio of a CBT for PDA versus a combined treatment of 
      CBT and pharmacotherapy. Eighty-four people followed a CBT either alone or combined 
      with medication. They have been evaluated before treatment, immediately after, as 
      well as one and two years later. The therapy efficacy is calculated at each 
      assessment according to a "Global Functioning Index". Direct and indirect costs are 
      calculated with the "Health Cost Interview". Results suggest that both treatments 
      are equally effective. However, CBT alone is less expensive than CBT with 
      pharmacotherapy. Thus, it offers a better cost-effectiveness ratio that even 
      increases in the long term.

TI  - Telemental health: A status update.
PG  - 223-30
LID - 10.1002/wps.20218 [doi]
AB  - A rather large body of literature now exists on the use of telemental health 
      services in the diagnosis and management of various psychiatric conditions. This 
      review aims to provide an up-to-date assessment of telemental health, focusing on 
      four main areas: computerized CBT (cCBT), Internet-based CBT (iCBT), virtual reality 
      exposure therapy (VRET), and mobile therapy (mTherapy). Four scientific databases 
      were searched and, where possible, larger, better-designed meta-analyses and 
      controlled trials were highlighted. Taken together, published studies support an 
      expanded role for telepsychiatry tools, with advantages that include increased care 
      access, enhanced efficiency, reduced stigma associated with visiting mental health 
      clinics, and the ability to bypass diagnosis-specific obstacles to treatment, such 
      as when social anxiety prevents a patient from leaving the house. Of 
      technology-mediated therapies, cCBT and iCBT possess the most efficacy evidence, 
      with VRET and mTherapy representing promising but less researched options that have 
      grown in parallel with virtual reality and mobile technology advances. Nonetheless, 
      telepsychiatry remains challenging because of the need for specific computer skills, 
      the difficulty in providing patients with a deep understanding or support, concerns 
      about the "therapeutic alliance", privacy fears, and the well documented problem of 
      patient attrition. Future studies should further test the efficacy, advantages and 
      limitations of technology-enabled CBT, as well as explore the online delivery of 
      other psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological modalities.

TI  - Poverty and response to treatment among panic disorder patients in primary care.
PG  - 1419-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite well-established links between poverty and poor mental illness 
      outcome as well as recent reports exploring racial and ethnic health disparities, 
      little is known about the outcomes of evidence-based psychiatric treatment for poor 
      individuals. METHOD: Primary care patients with panic disorder (N=232) who were 
      participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing a cognitive behavior 
      therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy intervention to usual care were divided into those 
      patients above (N=152) and below (N=80) the poverty line. Telephone assessments at 
      3, 6, 9, and 12 months were used to compare the amount of evidence-based care 
      received as well as clinical and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Poor subjects were 
      more severely ill at baseline, with more medical and psychiatric comorbidity. The 
      increases in the amount of evidence-based care and reductions in clinical symptoms 
      and disability were comparable in the two groups such that poorer individuals, 
      although responding equivalently, continued to be more ill and disabled at 12 
      months. CONCLUSIONS: The comparable response of poor individuals in this study 
      suggests that standard CBT and pharmacotherapy treatments for panic disorder do not 
      need to be "tailored" to be effective in poor populations. However, the more severe 
      illness both at baseline and follow-up in these poor individuals suggests that 
      treatment programs may need to be extended in order to treat residual symptoms and 
      disability in these patients so that they might achieve comparable levels of 
      remission.

TI  - Anxiety disorders: treatable regardless of the severity of comorbid alcohol 
      dependence.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - AIMS: Clinical and epidemiological research has shown that comorbidity is the rule 
      rather than exception in the case of psychiatric disorders. Cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) has been clearly demonstrated to be effective in treating anxiety and 
      avoidance symptoms in patient samples of social phobia and agoraphobia without 
      comorbid alcohol use disorders. It has recently been shown that treatment of 
      comorbid anxiety disorders in alcohol-dependent patients can also be very 
      successful. The purpose of the present study was to find predictors of treatment 
      success for comorbid anxiety disorders in alcohol-dependent patients. METHODS: The 
      study was conducted in a sample of 34 completers with a double diagnosis of alcohol 
      dependence and agoraphobia or social phobia who received CBT for their comorbid 
      anxiety disorder in a 32-week randomized controlled trial comparing alcohol and CBT 
      anxiety disorder treatment with alcohol treatment alone. In the current report, 
      treatment success was defined as a clinically significant change (recovery) on the 
      anxiety discomfort scale. RESULTS: The severity of comorbid alcohol dependence did 
      not influence the beneficial effect of CBT on the anxiety disorder. Psychological 
      distress (SCL-90), neuroticism (NEO N), conscientiousness (NEO C), gender, 
      employment and age of onset of alcohol dependence showed some predictive value. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-dependent males with a comorbid anxiety disorder seem to 
      benefit most from CBT if their alcohol dependence started after age 25, if they are 
      employed and if their general psychopathology is less severe. The most important 
      conclusion, however, is that even severely alcohol-dependent patients with an 
      anxiety disorder can benefit from psychotherapy for their anxiety disorder.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of cognitive behavior group therapy 
      in chronic back pain patients.
PG  - 563-8
LID - 10.3233/BMR-140518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is empirically well documented that psychotherapy is vital in the 
      treatment of chronic back pain. OBJECTIVE: To test in this randomized controlled 
      clinical trial whether cognitive behavior group therapy is effective in respect to 
      pain tolerance and disability apart from the effects on somatization in general and 
      additional to the effects of a multimodal inpatient orthopedic rehabilitation 
      programme. METHODS: Fifty-three patients were randomly assigned to an intervention 
      group, receiving six sessions of "cognitive behavior group therapy for back pain" 
      (CBT-BP), and 50 to a control group who got unspecific occupational therapy sessions 
      instead. Patients were suffering from chronic back pain for at least six months. All 
      patients were treated for 21 days in an orthopedic inpatient rehabilitation unit 
      with a multimodal orthopedic treatment, including active physical therapy, patient 
      education or motivation to exercise. RESULTS: In both groups there is a significant 
      improvement over time in the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90), the Rating of Health Locus 
      of Control Attributions, the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQS) and a 
      Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS-pain). There are significant interactions between 
      treatment group and VAS-pain and the FABQS, showing a superior improvement in the 
      intervention group, while no significant superiority is found for the SCL. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The experience of pain can be altered directly and not only through 
      improvement of depression or general somatoform complaints. The study replicates 
      other research and increases the evidence base for this mode of treatment. The 
      treatment effect can be called specific as it is found additional to a multimodal 
      inpatient care programme.

TI  - What good are positive emotions for treatment? Trait positive emotionality predicts 
      response to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for anxiety.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is empirically supported for the 
      treatment of anxiety disorders; however, not all individuals achieve recovery 
      following CBT. Positive emotions serve a number of functions that theoretically 
      should facilitate response to CBT - they promote flexible patterns of information 
      processing and assimilation of new information, encourage approach-oriented 
      behavior, and speed physiological recovery from negative emotions. We conducted a 
      secondary analysis of an existing clinical trial dataset to test the a priori 
      hypothesis that individual differences in trait positive emotions would predict CBT 
      response for anxiety. METHOD: Participants meeting diagnostic criteria for panic 
      disorder (n = 28) or generalized anxiety disorder (n = 31) completed 10 weekly 
      individual CBT sessions. Trait positive emotionality was assessed at pre-treatment, 
      and severity of anxiety symptoms and associated impairment was assessed throughout 
      treatment. RESULTS: Participants who reported a greater propensity to experience 
      positive emotions at pre-treatment displayed the largest reduction in anxiety 
      symptoms as well as fewer symptoms following treatment. Positive emotions remained a 
      robust predictor of change in symptoms when controlling for baseline depression 
      severity. CONCLUSIONS: Initial evidence supports the predictive value of trait 
      positive emotions as a prognostic indicator for CBT outcome in a GAD and PD sample.

TI  - A cognitive-behavioral intervention for emotion regulation in adults with 
      high-functioning autism spectrum disorders: study protocol for a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 231
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-14-231 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have 
      difficulties in social communication; thus, these individuals have trouble 
      understanding the mental states of others. Recent research also suggests that adults 
      with ASD are unable to understand their own mental states, which could lead to 
      difficulties in emotion-regulation. Some studies have reported the efficacy of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in improving emotion-regulation among children 
      with ASD. The current study will investigate the efficacy of group-based CBT for 
      adults with ASD. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomized, waitlist controlled, 
      single-blinded trial. The participants will be 60 adults with ASD; 30 will be 
      assigned to a CBT group and 30 to a waitlist control group. Primary outcome measures 
      are the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Coping Inventory for Stressful 
      Situations, the Motion Picture Mind-Reading task, and an ASD questionnaire. The 
      secondary outcome measures are the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
      Scale, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale 26-item version, the 
      Global Assessment of Functioning, State-trait Anxiety Inventory, Social Phobia and 
      Anxiety Inventory, and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. All will be administered 
      during the pre- and post-intervention, and 12 week follow-up periods. The CBT group 
      will receive group therapy over an 8 week period (one session per week) with each 
      session lasting approximately 100 minutes. Group therapy will consist of four or 
      five adults with ASD and two psychologists. We will be using visual materials for 
      this program, mainly the Cognitive Affective Training kit. DISCUSSION: This trial 
      will hopefully indicate the efficacy of group-based CBT for adults with high- 
      functioning ASD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in The University 
      Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry No. UMIN000006236.

TI  - Perceived Control is a Transdiagnostic Predictor of Cognitive-Behavior Therapy 
      Outcome for Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - 10-22
AB  - Perceived control has been proposed to be a general psychological vulnerability 
      factor that confers an elevated risk for developing anxiety disorders, but there is 
      limited research examining perceived control during cognitive-behavioral therapies 
      (CBT). The present study examined whether treatment resulted in improvements in 
      perceived control, and the indirect effects of CBT on changes in symptoms of 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and 
      panic disorder via changes in perceived control. Participants (n = 606) were a large 
      clinical sample presenting for treatment at an outpatient anxiety disorders clinic. 
      Participants completed a series of self-report questionnaires and a structured 
      clinical interview at an intake evaluation and at two follow-up assessments 12 and 
      24 months later, with the majority of participants initiating CBT between the first 
      two assessments. Results of latent growth curve models indicated that individuals 
      initiating CBT subsequently reported large increases in perceived control and 
      significant indirect effects of treatment on intraindividual changes in each of the 
      four anxiety disorders examined via intraindividual changes in perceived control. 
      These results suggest that the promotion of more adaptive perceptions of control is 
      associated with recovery from anxiety disorders. Furthermore, the consistent finding 
      of indirect effects across the four anxiety disorders examined underscores the 
      transdiagnostic importance of perceived control in predicting CBT outcomes.

TI  - The impacts of cognitive-behavioral therapy on the treatment of phobic disorders 
      measured by functional neuroimaging techniques: a systematic review.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Functional neuroimaging techniques represent fundamental tools in the 
      context of translational research integrating neurobiology, psychopathology, 
      neuropsychology, and therapeutics. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      has proven its efficacy in the treatment of anxiety disorders and may be useful in 
      phobias. The literature has shown that feelings and behaviors are mediated by 
      specific brain circuits, and changes in patterns of interaction should be associated 
      with cerebral alterations. Based on these concepts, a systematic review was 
      conducted aiming to evaluate the impact of CBT on phobic disorders measured by 
      functional neuroimaging techniques. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature 
      was conducted including studies published between January 1980 and April 2012. 
      Studies written in English, Spanish or Portuguese evaluating changes in the pattern 
      of functional neuroimaging before and after CBT in patients with phobic disorders 
      were included. RESULTS: The initial search strategy retrieved 45 studies. Six of 
      these studies met all inclusion criteria. Significant deactivations in the amygdala, 
      insula, thalamus and hippocampus, as well as activation of the medial orbitofrontal 
      cortex, were observed after CBT in phobic patients when compared with controls. 
      CONCLUSION: In spite of their technical limitations, neuroimaging techniques provide 
      neurobiological support for the efficacy of CBT in the treatment of phobic 
      disorders. Further studies are needed to confirm this conclusion.

AB  - Excessive attention toward aversive information may be a core mechanism underlying 
      emotional disorders, but little is known about whether this is predictive of 
      response to treatments. We evaluated whether enhanced attention toward aversive 
      stimuli, as indexed by an event-related potential component, the late positive 
      potential (LPP), would predict response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in 
      patients with social anxiety disorder and/or major depressive disorder. Thirty-two 
      patients receiving 12 weeks of CBT responded to briefly-presented pairs of aversive 
      and neutral pictures that served as targets or distracters while 
      electroencephaolography was recorded. Patients with larger pre-treatment LPPs to 
      aversive relative to neutral distracters (when targets were aversive) were more 
      likely to respond to CBT, and demonstrated larger reductions in symptoms of 
      depression and anxiety following treatment. Increased attention toward irrelevant 
      aversive stimuli may signal attenuated top-down control, so treatments like CBT that 
      improve this control could be beneficial for these individuals.

TI  - The outcome of children with selective mutism following cognitive behavioral 
      intervention: a follow-up study.
PG  - 481-7
LID - 10.1007/s00431-015-2651-0 [doi]
AB  - Selective mutism (SM) is a relatively rare childhood disorder and is underdiagnosed 
      and undertreated. The purpose of the retrospective naturalistic study was to examine 
      the long-term outcome of children with SM who were treated with specifically 
      designed modular cognitive behavioral therapy (MCBT). Parents of 36 children who met 
      diagnostic criteria of SM that received MCBT treatment were invited for a follow-up 
      evaluation. Parents were interviewed using structured scales and completed 
      questionnaires regarding the child, including the Selective Mutism Questionnaire 
      (SMQ). Twenty-four subjects were identified and evaluated. Their mean age ± SD of 
      onset of SM symptoms, beginning of treatment, and age at follow-up were 3.4 ± 1.4, 
      6.4 ± 3.1, and 9.3 ± 3.4 years, respectively. There was robust improvement from 
      beginning of treatment to follow-up evaluation in SM, social anxiety disorder, and 
      specific phobia symptoms. The recovery rate from SM was 84.2 %. CONCLUSION: 
      SM-focused MCBT is feasible in children and possibly effective in inducing long-term 
      reduction of SM and comorbid anxiety symptoms. WHAT IS KNOWN: • There are limited 
      empirical data on selective mutism (SM) treatment outcome and specifically on 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, with the majority of studies being uncontrolled case 
      reports of 1 to 2 cases each. • There is also limited data on the long-term outcome 
      of children with SM following treatment. What is New: • Modular cognitive behavioral 
      treatment is a feasible and possibly effective treatment for SM. Intervention at a 
      younger age is more effective comparing to an older age. • Treatment for SM also 
      decreases the rate of psychiatric comorbidities, including separation anxiety 
      disorder and specific phobia.

      therapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders.
PG  - 51-6, 59-61
AB  - In a particular success for translational research agendas, characterization of the 
      neuronal circuits underlying fear extinction, and basic research in animal 
      extinction paradigms, has led to intervention studies examining the use of 
      D-cycloserine (DCS) to enhance therapeutic learning from exposure-based 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). In this article, we review these intervention 
      studies, and discuss DCS augmentation of CBT relative to more traditional 
      combination-treatment strategies in the treatment of anxiety disorders. We offer an 
      accounting, based on evidence for internal context effects, of current limitations 
      in the combination of antidepressant or benzodiazepine medications with CBT and 
      discuss the advantages of isolated-dosing strategies with DCS relative to these 
      limitations. This strategy is contrasted with the chronic-dosing applications of DCS 
      for schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, and future directions for isolated-dosing 
      strategies are discussed.

TI  - Brain connectomics predict response to treatment in social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 680-5
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.109 [doi]
AB  - We asked whether brain connectomics can predict response to treatment for a 
      neuropsychiatric disorder better than conventional clinical measures. Pre-treatment 
      resting-state brain functional connectivity and diffusion-weighted structural 
      connectivity were measured in 38 patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) to 
      predict subsequent treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We used 
      a priori bilateral anatomical amygdala seed-driven resting connectivity and 
      probabilistic tractography of the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus together 
      with a data-driven multivoxel pattern analysis of whole-brain resting-state 
      connectivity before treatment to predict improvement in social anxiety after CBT. 
      Each connectomic measure improved the prediction of individuals' treatment outcomes 
      significantly better than a clinical measure of initial severity, and combining the 
      multimodal connectomics yielded a fivefold improvement in predicting treatment 
      response. Generalization of the findings was supported by leave-one-out 
      cross-validation. After dividing patients into better or worse responders, logistic 
      regression of connectomic predictors and initial severity combined with 
      leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a categorical prediction of clinical 
      improvement with 81% accuracy, 84% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Connectomics of 
      the human brain, measured by widely available imaging methods, may provide 
      brain-based biomarkers (neuromarkers) supporting precision medicine that better 
      guide patients with neuropsychiatric diseases to optimal available treatments, and 
      thus translate basic neuroimaging into medical practice.

PG  - 178-83
AB  - In the present study, the authors sought to determine whether the efficiency and 
      cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for panic disorder could 
      be improved by adjunctive computer-assisted therapy. Eighteen participants who met 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., revised; American 
      Psychiatric Association, 1987) criteria for panic disorder were randomly assigned to 
      a 12-session CBT (CBT 12) condition (D. H. Barlow & M. G. Craske, 1989) or to a 
      4-session computer-assisted CBT (CBT4-CA) condition. Palmtop computers, with a 
      program developed to incorporate basic principles of CBT, were used by CBT4-CA 
      clients whenever they felt anxious or wanted to practice the therapy techniques and 
      were used by all participants as a momentary assessment tool. CBT4-CA clients 
      carried the computer at all times and continued to use it for 8 weeks after 
      termination of therapy. Analyses of clinically significant changes showed 
      superiority of CBT12 at posttest on some measures; however, there were no 
      differences at follow-up.

TI  - Quality of and patient satisfaction with primary health care for anxiety disorders.
PG  - 970-6
LID - 10.4088/JCP.09m05626blu [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with anxiety disorders receive their care from primary 
      care practitioners (PCPs). The purpose of this study was to evaluate quality of and 
      patient satisfaction with primary health care for anxiety disorders. METHOD: A 
      survey was performed among 1,004 outpatients with anxiety disorders (diagnosed 
      according to DSM-IV) referred by their PCPs from 17 primary care clinical settings 
      (3 of which were university-affiliated) in 4 regions of the United States for 
      participation in the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) study, a 
      therapeutic trial. Participating research institutions were the University of 
      Washington at Seattle, the University of California at San Diego and Los Angeles, 
      and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at Little Rock. Enrollment took 
      place between June 2006 and April 2008. Patients were contacted by telephone after 
      enrollment to provide information about previous care received (during the 6 months 
      prior to referral) and satisfaction with that care. Quality-of-care indicators were 
      self-reported type, dose, and duration of antianxiety medication treatment and 
      self-reported psychotherapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) elements. 
      RESULTS: A total of 576 patients (57.4%) had received an appropriate antianxiety 
      medication in the previous 6 months, but only 289 patients (29.4% of 983 who 
      answered this question) had received the medication at adequate dose for at least 2 
      months. A total of 465 patients (46.3%) had received some counseling with at least 1 
      element of CBT, but only 213 patients (21.2%) had received counseling with a strong 
      (3+ elements) CBT focus. Overall, 416 patients (41.4%) had received quality 
      pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, and 81 patients (8.1%) had received both. Only 432 
      patients (44.8% of 964 who answered this question) were at least somewhat satisfied 
      with their mental health care. Receipt of quality psychotherapy was the sole 
      positive predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.71; 95% CI, 1.94-3.80; P < .0005) of 
      satisfaction with mental health care for anxiety. Moreover, there was a 
      dose-response relationship between the number of CBT elements consistently delivered 
      and satisfaction with care (test for trend, z = 4.06, P < .0005). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite recognition of these patients' anxiety disorders and referral by their PCPs 
      to an anxiety treatment study, fewer than half of the patients had in the prior 6 
      months received quality pharmacologic and/or psychosocial mental health care. 
      Receipt of CBT-oriented, quality psychosocial (but not pharmacologic) care showed a 
      strong dose-response relationship with satisfaction with mental health care.

TI  - Pathways to anxiety-depression comorbidity: A longitudinal examination of childhood 
      anxiety disorders.
PG  - 978-986
LID - 10.1002/da.22544 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are prevalent in youth and associated with later 
      depressive disorders. A recent model posits three distinct anxiety-depression 
      pathways. Pathway 1 represents youth with a diathesis to anxiety that increases risk 
      for depressive disorders; Pathway 2 describes youth with a shared anxiety-depression 
      diathesis; and Pathway 3 consists of youth with a diathesis for depression who 
      develop anxiety as a consequence of depression impairment. This is the first partial 
      test of this model following cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for child anxiety. 
      METHOD: The present study included individuals (N = 66; M age = 27.23 years, SD = 
      3.54) treated with CBT for childhood anxiety disorders 7-19 years (M = 16.24; SD = 
      3.56) earlier. Information regarding anxiety (i.e., social phobia (SoP), separation 
      anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)) and mood disorders 
      (i.e., major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymic disorders) was obtained at 
      pretreatment, posttreatment, and one or more follow-up intervals via interviews and 
      self-reports. RESULTS: Evidence of pathways from SoP, SAD, and GAD to later 
      depressive disorders was not observed. Treatment responders evidenced reduced GAD 
      and SoP over time, although SoP was observed to have a more chronic and enduring 
      pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for typically observed pathways from childhood 
      anxiety disorders was not observed. Future research should prospectively examine if 
      CBT treatment response disrupts commonly observed pathways.

TI  - Internet-delivered psychological treatments for mood and anxiety disorders: a 
      systematic review of their efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness.
PG  - e98118
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0098118 [doi]
LID - e98118
AB  - BACKGROUND: Greater access to evidence-based psychological treatments is needed. 
      This review aimed to evaluate whether internet-delivered psychological treatments 
      for mood and anxiety disorders are efficacious, noninferior to established 
      treatments, safe, and cost-effective for children, adolescents and adults. METHODS: 
      We searched the literature for studies published until March 2013. Randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) were considered for the assessment of short-term efficacy 
      and safety and were pooled in meta-analyses. Other designs were also considered for 
      long-term effect and cost-effectiveness. Comparisons against established treatments 
      were evaluated for noninferiority. Two reviewers independently assessed the relevant 
      studies for risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was graded using an 
      international grading system. RESULTS: A total of 52 relevant RCTs were identified 
      whereof 12 were excluded due to high risk of bias. Five cost-effectiveness studies 
      were identified and three were excluded due to high risk of bias. The included 
      trials mainly evaluated internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (I-CBT) 
      against a waiting list in adult volunteers and 88% were conducted in Sweden or 
      Australia. One trial involved children. For adults, the quality of evidence was 
      graded as moderate for the short-term efficacy of I-CBT vs. waiting list for 
      mild/moderate depression (d = 0.83; 95% CI 0.59, 1.07) and social phobia (d = 0.85; 
      95% CI 0.66, 1.05), and moderate for no efficacy of internet-delivered attention 
      bias modification vs. sham treatment for social phobia (d =  -0.04; 95% CI -0.24, 
      0.35). The quality of evidence was graded as low/very low for other disorders, 
      interventions, children/adolescents, noninferiority, adverse events, and 
      cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: I-CBT is a viable treatment option for adults with 
      depression and some anxiety disorders who request this treatment modality. Important 
      questions remain before broad implementation can be supported. Future research would 
      benefit from prioritizing adapting treatments to children/adolescents and using 
      noninferiority designs with established forms of treatment.

TI  - MAOA gene hypomethylation in panic disorder-reversibility of an epigenetic risk 
      pattern by psychotherapy.
PG  - e773
LID - 10.1038/tp.2016.41 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic signatures such as methylation of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene 
      have been found to be altered in panic disorder (PD). Hypothesizing temporal 
      plasticity of epigenetic processes as a mechanism of successful fear extinction, the 
      present psychotherapy-epigenetic study for we believe the first time investigated 
      MAOA methylation changes during the course of exposure-based cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) in PD. MAOA methylation was compared between N=28 female Caucasian PD 
      patients (discovery sample) and N=28 age- and sex-matched healthy controls via 
      direct sequencing of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA extracted from blood cells. MAOA 
      methylation was furthermore analyzed at baseline (T0) and after a 6-week CBT (T1) in 
      the discovery sample parallelized by a waiting time in healthy controls, as well as 
      in an independent sample of female PD patients (N=20). Patients exhibited lower MAOA 
      methylation than healthy controls (P<0.001), and baseline PD severity correlated 
      negatively with MAOA methylation (P=0.01). In the discovery sample, MAOA methylation 
      increased up to the level of healthy controls along with CBT response (number of 
      panic attacks; T0-T1: +3.37±2.17%), while non-responders further decreased in 
      methylation (-2.00±1.28%; P=0.001). In the replication sample, increases in MAOA 
      methylation correlated with agoraphobic symptom reduction after CBT (P=0.02-0.03). 
      The present results support previous evidence for MAOA hypomethylation as a PD risk 
      marker and suggest reversibility of MAOA hypomethylation as a potential epigenetic 
      correlate of response to CBT. The emerging notion of epigenetic signatures as a 
      mechanism of action of psychotherapeutic interventions may promote epigenetic 
      patterns as biomarkers of lasting extinction effects.

TI  - Treatment of music performance anxiety via psychological approaches: a review of 
      selected CBT and psychodynamic literature.
PG  - 141-8
AB  - Performance anxiety, or stage fright, is anxiety aroused about potential mishaps in 
      performance that expose feared inadequacies before an audience and which evoke 
      feelings of embarrassment and humilation. For affected musicians, performance 
      anxiety can be emotionally devastating, as their career choice in music may be 
      terminated or severely compromised. This paper focuses on the cognitive and 
      psychodynamic literature about music performance anxiety, with the emphasis that for 
      treatment "one size does not fit all." It reviews the factors underlying performance 
      anxiety and those factors which can exacerbate the condition in musicians. The two 
      major clinical treatment modalities within contemporary psychology, cognitive 
      behavior therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic treatments, are reviewed. While there are 
      more empirical studies of CBT in various populations in the literature, until 
      recently there was an indifference to empirical research by psychodynamic 
      investigators. However, meta-analyses show strong efficacy for psychodynamic 
      psychotherapy (in various disorders, not specifically music performance anxiety), 
      but also that the benefits of psychodynamic psychotherapy may endure longer and 
      increase with time.

TI  - Heart-focused anxiety as a mediating variable in the treatment of noncardiac chest 
      pain by cognitive-behavioral therapy and paroxetine.
PG  - 227-35
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2010.02.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), paroxetine 
      and placebo in the treatment of noncardiac chest pain (NCCP). We also investigated 
      whether pre- to mid-treatment reduction of (heart-focused) anxiety mediated mid- to 
      post-treatment pain reduction. METHODS: Sixty-nine adults with NCCP were randomly 
      assigned to 16 weeks of outpatient treatment with CBT, paroxetine or placebo. The 
      comparison between placebo and paroxetine was carried out in a double-blind fashion. 
      The main outcome measure was a chest pain index (duration*intensity) as derived from 
      daily pain diaries. Putative mediator measures were general anxiety (HADS:A) and 
      heart-focused anxiety (Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire). RESULTS: Eleven patients 
      treated with paroxetine or placebo dropped out prematurely. Intent-to-treat analysis 
      showed that CBT was significantly superior to placebo and to paroxetine in reducing 
      NCCP at posttreatment. Only CBT significantly reduced heart-focused anxiety compared 
      to placebo at mid- and post-treatment. Pre- to mid-treatment reduction of 
      heart-focused anxiety predicted mid- to post-treatment NCCP reduction. The indirect 
      effect of CBT on pain reduction by reducing heart-focused anxiety was significant 
      compared to placebo but not to paroxetine. CONCLUSION: CBT is an effective treatment 
      option for patients with NCCP. Paroxetine is not more effective than placebo on the 
      short term. Reduction of heart-focused anxiety by CBT seems to mediate subsequent 
      reduction of NCCP compared to placebo. The results provide further support for 
      cognitive-behavioral models of NCCP and point to the potential benefits of, in 
      particular, cognitive-behavioral interventions to modify heart-focused anxiety.

TI  - One-year follow-up of pharmacotherapy-resistant patients with panic disorder treated 
      with cognitive-behavior therapy: Outcome and predictors of remission.
PG  - 657-65
AB  - Non-response to pharmacotherapy for panic disorder (PD) is a well-documented 
      problem. However, little information exists to guide next-step strategies for these 
      non-responders. In addition to pharmacologic augmentation strategies, several 
      studies support the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for these patients, 
      although data on long-term outcomes has been lacking. In this study, we provide 
      one-year outcomes on a sample of 63 patients who completed group CBT for PD after 
      failing to respond adequately to previous pharmacotherapy. Sustained significant 
      benefit was found for all dimensional outcome scores, and nearly two-thirds of the 
      sample met remission criteria. This occurred with reductions in medication use over 
      the follow-up period. Negative predictors of remission status included comorbid 
      dysthymia, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. These results provide 
      additional evidence for the efficacy of CBT for medication non-responders with PD.

TI  - Asperger syndrome and anxiety disorders (PAsSA) treatment trial: a study protocol of 
      a pilot, multicentre, single-blind, randomised crossover trial of group cognitive 
      behavioural therapy.
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003449 [doi]
LID - e003449
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A number of studies have established that children, adolescents and 
      adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high functioning autism (HFA) have 
      significant problems with anxiety. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an 
      effective treatment for anxiety in a variety of clinical populations. There is a 
      growing interest in exploring the effectiveness of CBT for people with AS who have 
      mental health problems, but currently there are no known clinical trials involving 
      adults with AS or HFA. Studies with children who have AS have reported some success. 
      The current study aims to examine whether modified group CBT for clinically 
      significant anxiety in an AS population is likely to be efficacious. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: This study is a randomised, single-blind crossover trial. At least 36 
      individuals will be recruited and randomised into a treatment arm or a waiting-list 
      control arm. During treatment, individuals will receive 3 sessions of individual 
      CBT, followed by 21 sessions of group CBT. Primary outcome measures focus on 
      anxiety. Secondary outcome measures focus on everyday social and psychiatric 
      functioning, additional measures of anxiety and fear, depression, health-related 
      quality of life and treatment cost. Assessments will be administered at pregroup and 
      postgroup and at follow-up by researchers who are blinded to group allocation. The 
      trial aims to find out whether or not psychological treatments for anxiety can be 
      adapted and used to successfully treat the anxiety experienced by people with AS. 
      Furthermore, we aim to determine whether this intervention represents good value for 
      money. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial received a favourable ethical opinion 
      from a National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee. All participants 
      provided written informed consent. Findings will be shared with all trial 
      participants, and the general public, as well as the scientific community. TRIAL

AB  - Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can be treated effectively with either 
      disorder-specific cognitive behavior therapy (DS-CBT) or transdiagnostic CBT 
      (TD-CBT). The relative benefits of DS-CBT and TD-CBT for GAD and the relative 
      benefits of delivering treatment in clinician guided (CG-CBT) and self-guided 
      (SG-CBT) formats have not been examined. Participants with GAD (n=338) were randomly 
      allocated to receive an internet-delivered TD-CBT or DS-CBT intervention delivered 
      in either CG-CBT or SG-CBT formats. Large reductions in symptoms of GAD (Cohen's d ≥ 
      1.48; avg. reduction ≥ 50%) and comorbid major depressive disorder (Cohen's d ≥ 
      1.64; avg. reduction ≥ 45%), social anxiety disorder (Cohen's d ≥ 0.80; avg. 
      reduction ≥ 29%) and panic disorder (Cohen's d ≥ 0.55; avg. reduction ≥ 33%) were 
      found across the conditions. No substantive differences were observed between DS-CBT 
      and TD-CBT or CG-CBT and SG-CBT, highlighting the public health potential of 
      carefully developed TD-CBT and SG-CBT.

TI  - The feasibility and acceptability of a novel anxiety in bipolar disorder 
      intervention compared to treatment as usual: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 953-965
LID - 10.1002/da.22781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbid anxiety is common in bipolar disorder (BD) and associated with 
      worse clinical outcomes including increased suicidality. Despite effective 
      psychological treatments for anxiety, research into treating anxiety in BD is 
      underdeveloped. This paper describes a novel psychological intervention to address 
      anxiety in context of bipolar disorder (AIBD). METHODS: Adults with BD and 
      clinically significant anxiety symptoms were randomized to AIBD plus treatment as 
      usual (TAU) or TAU alone. AIBD offered 10 sessions of psychological therapy using a 
      formulation-based approach. Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated through 
      recruitment, retention, therapy attendance, alliance, fidelity, and qualitative 
      feedback. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 16, 48, and 80 weeks: interim 
      assessments of relapse at 32 and 64 weeks. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants were 
      recruited with 88% retention to 16 weeks and 74% to 80 weeks (similar between arms). 
      Therapy participants attended <mml:math 
      xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> 
      <mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>x</mml:mi> <mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover> 
      <mml:mspace/></mml:mrow> </mml:math> 7.7 (SD 2.8) sessions. Therapeutic alliance and 
      therapy fidelity were acceptable. Qualitative interviews indicated that participants 
      valued integrated support for anxiety with BD and coping strategies. Some suggested 
      a longer intervention period. Clinical outcomes were not significantly different 
      between arms up to 80 weeks follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: AIBD is feasible and acceptable 
      but lack of impact on clinical outcomes indicates that adaptations are required. 
      These are discussed in relation to qualitative feedback and recent literature 
      published since the trial completed.

TI  - Adequacy of treatment received by primary care patients with anxiety disorders.
PG  - 443-50
LID - 10.1002/da.22209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the adequacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy received 
      by primary care patients with anxiety disorders over up to 5 years of follow-up. 
      METHOD: Five hundred thirty-four primary care patients at 15 US sites, who screened 
      positive for anxiety symptoms, were assessed for anxiety disorders. Those meeting 
      anxiety disorder criteria were offered participation and interviewed again at six 
      and 12 months postintake, and yearly thereafter for up to 5 years. We utilized 
      existing definitions of appropriate pharmacotherapy and created definitions of 
      potentially adequate psychotherapy/cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). RESULTS: At 
      intake, of 534 primary care participants with anxiety disorders, 19% reported 
      receiving appropriate pharmacotherapy and 14% potentially adequate CBT. Overall, 28% 
      of participants reported receiving potentially adequate anxiety treatment, whether 
      pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or both. Over up to five years of follow-up, 
      appropriate pharmacotherapy was received by 60% and potentially adequate CBT by 36% 
      of the sample. Examined together, 69% of participants received any potentially 
      adequate treatment during the follow-up period. Over the course of follow-up, 
      primary care patients with MDD, panic disorder with agoraphobia, and with 
      medicaid/medicare were more likely to receive appropriate anxiety treatment. Ethnic 
      minority members were less likely to receive potentially adequate care. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Potentially adequate anxiety treatment was rarely received by primary care patients 
      with anxiety disorders at intake. Encouragingly, rates improved over the course of 
      the study. However, potentially adequate CBT remained much less utilized than 
      pharmacotherapy and racial-ethnic minority members were less likely to received 
      care, suggesting much room for improved dissemination of quality treatment.

TI  - Cognitive behaviour therapy for withdrawal from antidepressant medication: a single 
      case series.
PG  - 77-97
LID - 10.1017/S1352465810000512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has clearly established the efficacy of pharmacotherapy and 
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for depression. There is less literature 
      addressing cessation of treatment, such as relapse during withdrawal from 
      antidepressant medication. AIMS: The current study examines the role of 
      psychological constructs that may influence relapse or fear of relapse and lead to 
      resumption of medication. This hypothesizes that during withdrawal individuals may 
      misinterpret normal variations in mood and dysphoric or other symptoms as reduced 
      levels of medication in their bodies in keeping with a simplistic rationale for 
      antidepressants. METHOD: The study uses an intensive single case AB style design in 
      three cases during the withdrawal process. All participants had been treated with 
      CBT plus antidepressants and had previously attempted to withdraw from 
      antidepressants. The first part of the study naturalistically tracks belief changes 
      as medication decreases; the second examines changes in these if/when a CBT 
      intervention is introduced due to relapse or potential near-relapse. Daily 
      self-monitoring diaries were used to measure target variables, together with 
      standardized questionnaires up to 6 months follow-up. RESULTS: Changes in symptoms, 
      appraisal of symptoms, and beliefs about medication changed throughout the study. 
      All participants remained medication free at 6 months follow-up. Two cases received 
      CBT intervention due to possible relapse; the third underwent an unproblematic 
      withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of change are discussed in terms of current 
      approaches to medication cessation and the role of CBT during withdrawal.

TI  - The Beliefs about Emotions Scale: validity, reliability and sensitivity to change.
PG  - 285-92
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.09.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Beliefs about the unacceptability of experiencing or expressing negative 
      emotions have been noted in individuals with a range of problems, including chronic 
      fatigue syndrome (CFS), irritable bowel syndrome, somatization disorder, depression, 
      eating disorders, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and borderline 
      personality disorder. These beliefs are likely to have implications for emotion 
      regulation and processing, and are addressed explicitly or implicitly within many 
      therapies including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy (MBCT), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). This article describes 
      the development, validation, and internal reliability of the Beliefs about Emotions 
      Scale (BES), a self-report questionnaire to assess such beliefs. METHODS: The new 
      scale was completed by people with CFS (n=121) and healthy controls (n=73). 
      Twenty-two individuals with CFS completed the scale before and after CBT. RESULTS: 
      People with CFS had significantly higher scores on this new questionnaire than 
      healthy controls. Principal components analysis identified one factor, and the scale 
      had high internal consistency (0.91). Scores on the BES were most highly correlated 
      with a measure of negative perfectionism (r=0.59) and also showed significant 
      correlations with measures of dysfunctional attitudes, self-sacrifice, depression, 
      anxiety, and fatigue. When completed before and after CBT for CFS, the questionnaire 
      was sufficiently sensitive to detect a significant reduction in endorsement of 
      unhelpful beliefs about emotions. CONCLUSION: The new Beliefs about Emotions Scale 
      showed good internal reliability, validity and sensitivity to change.

TI  - An evaluation of large group CBT psycho-education for anxiety disorders delivered in 
      routine practice.
PG  - 107-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical utility and acceptability of a brief CBT 
      psycho-educational course delivered in an NHS psychotherapy service. METHODS: All 
      patients referred, found suitable for CBT, and who had an anxiety disorder, were 
      invited to enrol in a psycho-education course, delivered in an outpatient mental 
      health clinic by two mental health nurses with post-registration training in CBT. 
      There were up to 24 patients in each course. Outcome measures used were CORE-OM and 
      Fear Questionnaire administered pre-course and at 12-week follow-up and Client 
      Satisfaction Questionnaire administered post-course. RESULTS: One-hundred and ninety 
      one patients were referred. Of these 120 remained in contact with the service to the 
      follow-up meeting. Ninety-seven patients were discharged at the follow-up point and 
      92 requested further individual psychotherapy. A number of patients made a clinical 
      and reliable change as measured by CORE-OM and Fear Questionnaire. One-hundred and 
      two patients completed the CSQ-8 reporting high satisfaction with the intervention. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The intervention appears to be helpful for a number of patients and 
      largely acceptable for most patients that attend. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Large group 
      psycho-educational interventions for anxiety disorders could be increasingly used as 
      a method of delivering low intensity treatments within a stepped care model of the 
      treatment of anxiety disorders. The intervention is relatively simple to deliver and 
      potentially could be delivered by primary care clinicians.

      reduction in cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are debilitating conditions that can be treated with 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Increased understanding of the neurobiological 
      correlates of CBT may inform treatment improvements and personalization. Prior 
      neuroimaging studies point to treatment-related changes in anterior cingulate, 
      insula, and other prefrontal regions during emotional processing, yet to date the 
      impact of CBT on neural substrates of "top down" emotion regulation remains 
      understudied. We examined the relationship between symptom changes assessed over the 
      course of CBT treatment sessions and pre- to post-treatment neural change during an 
      emotion regulation task. METHOD: In the current study, a sample of 30 participants 
      with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder completed a reappraisal-based 
      emotion regulation task while undergoing fMRI before and after completing CBT. 
      RESULTS: Reduced activation in the parahippocampal gyrus was observed from pre- to 
      post-treatment during periods of reducing versus maintaining emotion. 
      Parahippocampal activation was associated with change in symptoms over the course of 
      treatment and post-treatment responder status. Results suggest that, from pre- to 
      post-CBT, participants demonstrated downregulation of neural responses during 
      effortful cognitive emotion regulation. LIMITATIONS: Effects were not observed in 
      frontoparietal systems as would be hypothesized based on prior literature, 
      suggesting that treatment-related change could occur outside of fronto-parietal and 
      limbic regions that are central to most models of neural functioning in anxiety 
      disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Continued work is needed to better understand how CBT 
      affects cognitive control and memory processes that are hypothesized to support 
      reappraisal as a strategy for emotion regulation.

TI  - Management of treatment-refractory panic disorder.
PG  - 97-110
AB  - Treatment resistance remains a relatively common problem in panic disorder (PD) 
      despite the success of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as first-line agents. Factors contributing to 
      medication treatment resistance include inadequacy of trial duration, improper 
      dosage, poor tolerability, noncompliance, and medical and psychiatric comorbidity. 
      Poor tolerability to the SSRIs can frequently be addressed by judicious lowering of 
      the initial dose, with a gradual upward titration. For patients who have not 
      responded to one or more adequate trials of SSRIs, options include combination 
      treatment with a benzodiazepine or tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), augmentation with 
      pindolol, or switching to a different class of medication. The newer 
      antidepressants, particularly venlafaxine XR, seem promising as alternatives, and 
      might be beneficial for the refractory patient with a comorbid mood disorder. 
      Anticonvulsants and olanzapine might be particularly beneficial for the refractory 
      patient with hypomania, irritability, and insomnia, who also has demonstrated acute 
      SSRI hypersensitivity. Experimental therapeutics in refractory panic probably will 
      continue to examine the role of corticotropin releasing factor and glutamate/GABA 
      systems. The role of CBT in the medication refractory patient has been explored, 
      with preliminary suggestions of efficacy.

TI  - Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy for depression and anxiety update: a 
      systematic review and economic evaluation.
PG  - iii, xi-xiv, 1-168
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (CCBT) for the 
      treatment of anxiety, depression, phobias, panic and obsessive-compulsive behaviour 
      (OCD). The software packages to be considered include Beating the Blues (BtB), 
      Overcoming Depression: a five areas approach, FearFighter (FF), Cope and BT Steps. 
      Other packages or programmes incorporating CCBT were also considered. DATA SOURCES: 
      Electronic databases from 1966 to March 2004. Evidence submitted by sponsors for 
      CCBT products. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review was a review of the literature 
      and the evidence submitted by sponsors for each of the products. A series of 
      cost-effectiveness models was developed and run by the project team for the five 
      CCBT products across the three mental health conditions. RESULTS: Twenty studies 
      were identified in the clinical effectiveness review. The analysis of these results 
      showed some evidence that CCBT is as effective as therapist-led cognitive behaviour 
      therapy (TCBT) for the treatment of depression/anxiety and phobia/panic and is more 
      effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of depression/anxiety. CCBT 
      also appears to reduce therapist time compared with TCBT. When reviewing 
      cost-effectiveness studies, only one published economic evaluation of CCBT was 
      found. This was an economic evaluation of the depression software BtB alongside a 
      randomised controlled trial (RCT), which found that BtB was cost-effective against 
      TAU in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (less than 2000 pounds), 
      however it contained weaknesses that were then addressed in the cost-effectiveness 
      model developed for the study. The results of the model for the depression software 
      packages in terms of incremental cost per QALY compared with TAU and the chance of 
      being cost-effective at 30,000 pounds per QALY were for BtB 1801 pounds and 86.8%, 
      for Cope 7139 pounds and 62.6% and for Overcoming Depression 5391 pounds and 54.4%. 
      The strength of the BtB software being that it has been evaluated in the context of 
      an RCT with a control group. The subgroup analysis found no differences across the 
      severity groupings. For phobia/panic software, the model showed an incremental cost 
      per QALY of FF over relaxation was 2380 pounds. Its position compared with TCBT is 
      less clear. When modelling OCD packages, using the practice-level licence cost meant 
      that BT Steps was dominated by TCBT, which had significantly better outcomes and was 
      cheaper. However, the cheaper PCT licence resulted in the incremental 
      cost-effectiveness of BT Steps over relaxation being 15,581 pounds and TCBT over BT 
      Steps being 22,484 pounds. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings are subject to 
      substantial uncertainties around the organisational level for purchasing these 
      products and the likely throughput. This is in addition to concerns with the quality 
      of evidence on response to therapy, longer term outcomes and quality of life. The 
      position of CCBT within a stepped care programme needs to be identified, as well as 
      its relationship to other efforts to increase access to CBT and psychological 
      therapies. Research is needed to compare CCBT with other therapies that reduce 
      therapist time, in particular bibliotherapy and to explore the use of CCBT via the 
      Internet. Independent research is needed, particularly RCTs, that examine areas such 
      as patient preference and therapist involvement within primary care.

TI  - The therapeutic relationship in cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy for 
      anxious youth.
PG  - 859-64
LID - 10.1037/a0033294 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the therapeutic relationship with cognitive-behavioral 
      therapists and with pharmacotherapists for youth from the Child/Adolescent Anxiety 
      Multimodal Study (Walkup et al., 2008). The therapeutic relationship was examined in 
      relation to treatment outcomes. METHOD: Participants were 488 youth (ages 7-17 
      years; 50% male) randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping Cat), 
      pharmacotherapy (sertraline), their combination, or placebo pill. Participants met 
      criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety 
      disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th 
      ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The therapeutic relationship was 
      assessed by youth report at Weeks 6 and 12 of treatment using the Child's Perception 
      of Therapeutic Relationship scale (Kendall et al., 1997). Outcome measures 
      (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale; Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology 
      Anxiety Study Group, 2002; and Clinical Global Impressions Scales; Guy, 1976) were 
      completed by independent evaluators blind to condition. RESULTS: For youth who 
      received CBT only, a stronger therapeutic relationship predicted positive treatment 
      outcome. In contrast, the therapeutic relationship did not predict outcome for youth 
      receiving sertraline, combined treatment, or placebo. CONCLUSION: A therapeutic 
      relationship may be important for anxious youth who receive CBT alone.

TI  - Extinction learning in childhood anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder 
      and post-traumatic stress disorder: implications for treatment.
PG  - 1155-74
LID - 10.1080/14737175.2016.1199276 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Threat conditioning and extinction play an important role in anxiety 
      disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD). Although these conditions commonly affect children, threat conditioning and 
      extinction have been primarily studied in adults. However, differences in 
      phenomenology and neural architecture prohibit the generalization of adult findings 
      to youth. AREAS COVERED: A comprehensive literature search using PubMed and PsycInfo 
      was conducted to identify studies that have used differential conditioning tasks to 
      examine threat acquisition and extinction in youth. The information obtained from 
      this review helps to clarify the influence of these processes on the etiology and 
      treatment of youth with OCD, PTSD and other anxiety disorders. Thirty studies of 
      threat conditioning and extinction were identified Expert commentary: Youth with 
      anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD have largely comparable threat acquisition relative 
      to unaffected controls, with some distinctions noted for youth with PTSD or youth 
      who have suffered maltreatment. However, impaired extinction was consistently 
      observed across youth with these disorders and appears to be consistent with 
      deficiencies in inhibitory learning. Incorporating strategies to improve inhibitory 
      learning may improve extinction learning within extinction-based treatments like 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Strategies to improve inhibitory learning in CBT 
      are discussed.

TI  - Context in the clinic: how well do cognitive-behavioral therapies and medications 
      work in combination?
PG  - 987-97
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy demonstrate efficacy across 
      the anxiety disorders, but recognition of their limitations has sparked interest in 
      combining modalities to maximize benefit. This article reviews the empirical 
      literature to examine whether combining treatments influences efficacy of either 
      monotherapy. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of published randomized 
      trials that compared combined treatment with pharmacologic or CBT monotherapies. Ten 
      studies that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed in detail, and within-subjects 
      effect sizes were calculated to compare treatment conditions within and across 
      studies. At posttreatment and follow-up, effect size and percentage responder data 
      failed to clearly demonstrate an advantage or disadvantage of combined treatment 
      over CBT alone for obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, and generalized 
      anxiety disorder. Some advantage of combined treatment over pharmacotherapy alone 
      emerged from the few studies that allowed for such a direct comparison. In contrast, 
      combined treatment for panic disorder seems to provide an advantage over CBT alone 
      at posttreatment, but is associated with greater relapse after treatment 
      discontinuation. The advantage of combined treatment may vary across the anxiety 
      disorders. The potential differences in usefulness of combined treatment are 
      discussed, directions for future research are suggested, and implications for 
      clinical practice are considered.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy in anxiety disorders: current state of the evidence.
PG  - 413-21
AB  - A plethora of studies have examined the efficacy and effectiveness of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for adult anxiety disorders. In recent years, 
      several meta-analyses have been conducted to quantitatively review the evidence of 
      CBT for anxiety disorders, each using different inclusion criteria for studies, such 
      as use of control conditions or type of study environment. This review aims to 
      summarize and to discuss the current state of the evidence regarding CBT treatment 
      for panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Overall, CBT 
      demonstrates both efficacy in randomized controlled trials and effectiveness in 
      naturalistic settings in the treatment of adult anxiety disorders. However, due to 
      methodological issues, the magnitude of effect is currently difficult to estimate. 
      In conclusion, CBT appears to be both efficacious and effective in the treatment of 
      anxiety disorders, but more high-quality studies are needed to better estimate the 
      magnitude of the effect.

TI  - From neuroscience to evidence based psychological treatments - The promise and the

AB  - This ECNP meeting was designed to build bridges between different constituencies of 
      mental illness treatment researchers from a range of backgrounds with a specific 
      focus on enhancing the development of novel, evidence based, psychological 
      treatments. In particular we wished to explore the potential for basic neuroscience 
      to support the development of more effective psychological treatments, just as this 
      approach is starting to illuminate the actions of drugs. To fulfil this aim, a 
      selection of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists and neuroscientists were invited 
      to sit at the same table. The starting point of the meeting was the proposition that 
      we know certain psychological treatments work, but we have only an approximate 
      understanding of why they work. The first task in developing a coherent mental 
      health science would therefore be to uncover the mechanisms (at all levels of 
      analysis) of effective psychological treatments. Delineating these mechanisms, a 
      task that will require input from both the clinic and the laboratory, will provide a 
      key foundation for the rational optimisation of psychological treatments. As 
      reviewed in this paper, the speakers at the meeting reviewed recent advances in the 
      understanding of clinical and cognitive psychology, neuroscience, experimental 
      psychopathology, and treatment delivery technology focussed primarily on anxiety 
      disorders and depression. We started by asking three rhetorical questions: What has 
      psychology done for treatment? What has technology done for psychology? What has 
      neuroscience done for psychology? We then addressed how research in five broad 
      research areas could inform the future development of better treatments: Attention, 
      Conditioning, Compulsions and addiction, Emotional Memory, and Reward and emotional 
      bias. Research in all these areas (and more) can be harnessed to neuroscience since 
      psychological therapies are a learning process with a biological basis in the brain. 
      Because current treatment approaches are not fully satisfactory, there is an 
      imperative to understand why not. And when psychological therapies do work we need 
      to understand why this is the case, and how we can improve them. We may be able to 
      improve accessibility to treatment without understanding mechanisms. But for 
      treatment innovation and improvement, mechanistic insights may actually help. 
      Applying neuroscience in this way will become an additional mission for ECNP.

TI  - Anxiety Disorders in Caucasian and African American Children: A Comparison of 
      Clinical Characteristics, Treatment Process Variables, and Treatment Outcomes.

AB  - This study examined racial differences in anxious youth using data from the 
      Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) [1]. Specifically, the study aims 
      addressed whether African American (n = 44) versus Caucasian (n = 359) children 
      varied on (1) baseline clinical characteristics, (2) treatment process variables, 
      and (3) treatment outcomes. Participants were ages 7-17 and met DSM-IV-TR criteria 
      for generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety disorder. 
      Baseline data, as well as outcome data at 12 and 24 weeks, were obtained by 
      independent evaluators. Weekly treatment process variables were collected by 
      therapists. Results indicated no racial differences on baseline clinical 
      characteristics. However, African American participants attended fewer psychotherapy 
      and pharmacotherapy sessions, and were rated by therapists as less involved and 
      compliant, in addition to showing lower mastery of CBT. Once these and other 
      demographic factors were accounted for, race was not a significant predictor of 
      response, remission, or relapse. Implications of these findings suggest African 
      American and Caucasian youth are more similar than different with respect to the 
      manifestations of anxiety and differences in outcomes are likely due to treatment 
      barriers to session attendance and therapist engagement.

TI  - Rapid tryptophan depletion following cognitive behavioural therapy for panic 
      disorder.
PG  - 593-602
LID - 10.1007/s00213-009-1696-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of rapid tryptophan 
      depletion (RTD) combined with a panicogenic challenge in patients with panic 
      disorder who had responded to treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). We 
      hypothesised that RTD (compared with the control drink) would result in an increase 
      in anxiety symptoms when provoked by a panicogenic challenge with the benzodiazepine 
      antagonist, flumazenil. METHODS: Nine patients with panic disorder who had responded 
      to CBT received a tryptophan-free amino acid drink on one occasion and a control 
      drink on the other in a double-blind crossover design. In addition, they received 
      flumazenil and placebo infusions on each day. RESULTS: Our hypothesis regarding the 
      effects of RTD was supported by findings of a significant interaction between RTD 
      and flumazenil on measures from visual analogues scales (total) and the Spielberger 
      State Anxiety inventory. A somewhat unexpected finding was that in this group of CBT 
      responders, the panicogenic effect of flumazenil was not completely blocked by 
      treatment. This meant that although four of the nine subjects (44%) reported a 
      panicogenic effect of flumazenil on the RTD day, this was not significantly 
      different from the rate of panic attacks in response to flumazenil on the control 
      day. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the partial return of symptoms in response to 
      flumazenil reflects a vulnerability to RTD in this group of panic disorder patients 
      who had responded to treatment with CBT.

TI  - Transfer of manualized Short Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) for social 
      phobia into clinical practice: study protocol for a cluster-randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 142
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-12-142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychodynamic psychotherapy is frequently applied in the treatment of 
      social phobia. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of studies on the transfer of 
      manualized treatments to routine psychodynamic practice. Our study is the first one 
      to examine the effects of additional training in a manualized Short Term 
      Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) procedure on outcome in routine psychotherapy for 
      social phobia. This study is an extension to a large multi-site RCT (N = 512) 
      comparing the efficacy of STPP to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) of Social 
      Phobia. METHODS/DESIGN: The manualized treatment is designed for a time limited 
      approach with 25 individual sessions of STPP over 6 months. Private practitioners 
      will be randomized to training in manualized STPP vs. treatment as usual without a 
      specific training (control condition). We plan to enrol a total of 105 patients (84 
      completers). Assessments will be conducted before treatment starts, after 8 and 15 
      weeks, after 25 treatment sessions, at the end of treatment, 6 months and 12 months 
      after termination of treatment. The primary outcome measure is the Liebowitz Social 
      Anxiety Scale. Remission from social phobia is defined scoring with 30 or less 
      points on this scale. DISCUSSION: We will investigate how the treatment can be 
      transferred from a controlled trial into the less structured setting of routine 
      clinical care. This question represents Phase IV of psychotherapy research. It 
      combines the benefits of randomized controlled and naturalistic research. The study 
      is genuinely designed to promote faster and more widespread dissemination of 
      effective interventions. It will answer the questions whether manualized STPP can be 
      implemented into routine outpatient care, whether the new methods improve treatment 
      courses and outcomes and whether treatment effects reached in routine 
      psychotherapeutic treatments are comparable to those of the controlled, strictly 
      manualized treatment of the main study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials

TI  - Single-subject anxiety treatment outcome prediction using functional neuroimaging.
PG  - 1254-61
LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.328 [doi]
AB  - The possibility of individualized treatment prediction has profound implications for 
      the development of personalized interventions for patients with anxiety disorders. 
      Here we utilize random forest classification and pre-treatment functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) data from individuals with generalized anxiety disorder 
      (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) to generate individual subject treatment outcome 
      predictions. Before cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 48 adults (25 GAD and 23 PD) 
      reduced (via cognitive reappraisal) or maintained their emotional responses to 
      negative images during fMRI scanning. CBT responder status was predicted using 
      activations from 70 anatomically defined regions. The final random forest model 
      included 10 predictors contributing most to classification accuracy. A similar 
      analysis was conducted using the clinical and demographic variables. Activations in 
      the hippocampus during maintenance and anterior insula, superior temporal, 
      supramarginal, and superior frontal gyri during reappraisal were among the best 
      predictors, with greater activation in responders than non-responders. The final 
      fMRI-based model yielded 79% accuracy, with good sensitivity (0.86), specificity 
      (0.68), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (2.73, 0.20). Clinical and 
      demographic variables yielded poorer accuracy (69%), sensitivity (0.79), specificity 
      (0.53), and likelihood ratios (1.67, 0.39). This is the first use of random forest 
      models to predict treatment outcome from pre-treatment neuroimaging data in 
      psychiatry. Together, random forest models and fMRI can provide single-subject 
      predictions with good test characteristics. Moreover, activation patterns are 
      consistent with the notion that greater activation in cortico-limbic circuitry 
      predicts better CBT response in GAD and PD.

TI  - Client resistance predicts outcomes in cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic 
      disorder.
PG  - 1020-1032
LID - 10.1080/10503307.2018.1504174 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Little is known about how therapy processes relate to outcome in 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder (PD). This study examined 
      whether client resistance predicts CBT for PD outcomes beyond the effects of 
      established pre-treatment predictors. A secondary aim was to assess the consistency 
      of resistance over treatment. Method: Data were from 71 adults participating in up 
      to 24 biweekly sessions of CBT in a randomized controlled trial. Panic severity was 
      assessed before, during (at Weeks 1, 5, and 9), and at termination of treatment 
      (Week 12) using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale. Trained coders reliably rated 
      resistance in videos of Sessions 2 and 10 using the Client Resistance Code. Results: 
      Resistance was found to be moderately consistent (r = .64). Although overall 
      resistance was unrelated to outcomes, hierarchical linear modeling revealed that 
      openly hostile resistance at Session 10 predicted significantly diminished symptom 
      change (r = .28, CI(95%) = [.01, .51]), beyond the effects of pretreatment 
      predictors. Hostile resistance at Session 2 predicted attrition (r(rb) = -.30, 
      p = .001), even after established predictors were controlled. Conclusions: Although 
      some forms of resistance may be benign, openly hostile resistance is an important 
      therapy marker that warrants increased clinical and research attention.

TI  - Guided internet treatment for anxiety disorders. As effective as face-to-face 
      therapies?
PG  - 3-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Guided Internet-delivered treatments were developed in the late 1990s 
      and have since been tested in numerous controlled trials. While promising, there are 
      yet few direct comparisons between Internet treatments and traditional face-to-face 
      treatments. The aim of the present study is to present an overview of the evidence 
      in the field of anxiety disorders. METHOD: Studies were located, including 
      unpublished trials from our research group in Sweden. RESULTS: Results of direct 
      comparative trials on panic disorder (n=3) and social anxiety disorder (n=3) show 
      equivalent outcomes. One study on specific phobia did not show equivalent outcomes 
      with an advantage for face-to-face treatment. However, a systematic review by 
      Cuijpers et al. (2010) found equivalent outcomes across several self-help formats, 
      suggesting that guided self-help overall can be as affective as face-to-face 
      treatments. CONCLUSION: Overall, there are still few large-scale trials and 
      statistical power is often limited. A preliminary conclusion is that guided Internet 
      treatment can be as effective as face-to-face treatments, but there is a need to 
      investigate moderators and mediators of the outcome.

TI  - Benefits of child-focused anxiety treatments for parents and family functioning.
PG  - 865-72
LID - 10.1002/da.22055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine (1) changes in parent (global psychological distress, trait 
      anxiety) and family (dysfunction, burden) functioning following 12 weeks of 
      child-focused anxiety treatment, and (2) whether changes in these parent and family 
      factors were associated with child's treatment condition and response. METHODS: 
      Participants were 488 youth ages 7-17 years (50% female; mean age 10.7 years) who 
      met DSM-IV-TR criteria for social phobia, separation anxiety, and/or generalized 
      anxiety disorder, and their parents. Youth were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of 
      "Coping Cat" individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication management 
      with sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or medication management with pill 
      placebo (PBO) within the multisite Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). 
      At pre- and posttreatment, parents completed measures of trait anxiety, 
      psychological distress, family functioning, and burden of child illness; children 
      completed a measure of family functioning. Blinded independent evaluators rated 
      child's response to treatment using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale 
      at posttreatment. RESULTS: Analyses of covariance revealed that parental 
      psychological distress and trait anxiety, and parent-reported family dysfunction 
      improved only for parents of children who were rated as treatment responders, and 
      these changes were unrelated to treatment condition. Family burden and 
      child-reported family dysfunction improved significantly from pre- to posttreatment 
      regardless of treatment condition or response. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that 
      child-focused anxiety treatments, regardless of intervention condition, can result 
      in improvements in nontargeted parent symptoms and family functioning particularly 
      when children respond successfully to the treatment.

TI  - [Selective mutism].
PG  - 2641-6
AB  - Selective mutism is a disorder closely linked to anxiety disorders in particular 
      social phobia. Heightened sensitivity to emotional stress factors and coping with 
      social anxiety may be part of the causes leading to the failure to speak. Follow-up 
      studies confirm the fact that selective mutism is a very persistent disorder with a 
      general tendency of poor outcome in particular if not intensively treated. Current 
      treatment combines different modalities of cognitive-behavioural therapies which are 
      aimed to reduce anxiety symptoms and to improve verbal communication. Enhancing of 
      parent-child interaction is often needed to improve the child's emotion regulation 
      skills. SSRI medication, especially fluoxetine, may improve outcome when combined 
      with therapy.

TI  - Incremental benefits and cost of coordinated anxiety learning and management for 
      anxiety treatment in primary care.
PG  - 1937-48
LID - 10.1017/S0033291711002893 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving the quality of mental health care requires integrating 
      successful research interventions into 'real-world' practice settings. Coordinated 
      Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) is a treatment-delivery model for anxiety 
      disorders encountered in primary care. CALM offers cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT), medication, or both; non-expert care managers assisting primary care 
      clinicians with adherence promotion and medication optimization; computer-assisted 
      CBT delivery; and outcome monitoring. This study describes incremental benefits, 
      costs and net benefits of CALM versus usual care (UC). METHOD: The CALM randomized, 
      controlled effectiveness trial was conducted in 17 primary care clinics in four US 
      cities from 2006 to 2009. Of 1062 eligible patients, 1004 English- or 
      Spanish-speaking patients aged 18-75 years with panic disorder (PD), generalized 
      anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and/or post-traumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) with or without major depression were randomized. Anxiety-free days 
      (AFDs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and expenditures for out-patient visits, 
      emergency room (ER) visits, in-patient stays and psychiatric medications were 
      estimated based on blinded telephone assessments at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. 
      RESULTS: Over 18 months, CALM participants, on average, experienced 57.1 more AFDs 
      [95% confidence interval (CI) 31-83] and $245 additional medical expenses (95% CI 
      $-733 to $1223). The mean incremental net benefit (INB) of CALM versus UC was 
      positive when an AFD was valued ≥$4. For QALYs based on the Short-Form Health 
      Survey-12 (SF-12) and the EuroQol EQ-5D, the mean INB was positive at ≥$5000. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with UC, CALM provides significant benefits with modest 
      increases in health-care expenditures.

TI  - Brief Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Anxious Youth: Feasibility and Initial 
      Outcomes.
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpra.2012.07.003 [doi]
AB  - We developed and evaluated a brief (8-session) version of cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (BCBT) for anxiety disorders in youth ages 6 to 13. This report describes 
      the design and development of the BCBT program and intervention materials (therapist 
      treatment manual and child treatment workbook) and an initial evaluation of child 
      treatment outcomes. Twenty-six children who met diagnostic criteria for a principal 
      anxiety diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, 
      and/or social phobia were enrolled. Results suggest that BCBT is a feasible, 
      acceptable, and beneficial treatment for anxious youth. Future research is needed to 
      examine the relative efficacy of BCBT and CBT for child anxiety in a randomized 
      controlled trial.

TI  - Study protocol for POSITIF, a randomised multicentre feasibility trial of a brief 
      cognitive-behavioural intervention plus information versus information alone for the 
      treatment of post-stroke fatigue.
PG  - 84
LID - 10.1186/s40814-020-00622-0 [doi]
LID - 84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately, half of stroke survivors experience fatigue. Fatigue may 
      persist for many months and interferes with participation in everyday activities and 
      has a negative impact on social and family relationships, return to work, and 
      quality of life. Fatigue is among the top 10 priorities for 'Life after Stroke' 
      research for stroke survivors, carers, and clinicians. We previously developed and 
      tested in a small uncontrolled pilot study a manualised, clinical 
      psychologist-delivered, face-to-face intervention, informed by cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT). We then adapted it for delivery by trained therapists via telephone. 
      We now aim to test the feasibility of this approach in a parallel group, randomised 
      controlled feasibility trial (Post Stroke Intervention Trial In Fatigue, POSITIF). 
      METHODS/DESIGN: POSITIF aims to recruit 75 stroke survivors between 3 months and 
      2 years post-stroke who would like treatment for their fatigue. Eligible consenting 
      stroke survivors will be randomised to either a 7-session manualised 
      telephone-delivered intervention based on CBT principles plus information about 
      fatigue, or information only. The aims of the intervention are to (i) provide an 
      explanation for post-stroke fatigue, in particular that it is potentially reversible 
      (an educational approach), (ii) encourage participants to overcome the fear of 
      taking physical activity and challenge negative thinking (a cognitive approach) and 
      (iii) promote a balance between daily activities, rest and sleep and then gradually 
      increase levels of physical activity (a behavioural approach). Fatigue, mood, 
      quality of life, return to work and putative mediators will be assessed at baseline 
      (just before randomisation), at the end of treatment and 6 months after 
      randomisation. POSITIF will determine the feasibility of recruitment, adherence to 
      the intervention and the resources required to deliver the intervention in a larger 
      trial. DISCUSSION: The POSITIF feasibility trial will recruit until 31 January 2020. 
      Data will inform the utility and design of a future adequately powered randomised 
      controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03551327. Registered on 
      11 June 2018.

TI  - Establishing the neurobiologic basis of treatment in children and adolescents with 
      generalized anxiety disorder.
PG  - 328-39
LID - 10.1002/da.21913 [doi]
AB  - Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with significant morbidity in 
      children and adolescents, yet only recently have the neuropharmacology and 
      neurophysiology of this condition been studied in youth. Accumulating data suggest 
      structural and functional abnormalities within the brain's fear networks in youth 
      with GAD. Additionally, seven studies examined the efficacy of medications that 
      modulate this system and, in some cases, the direct effects of these medications on 
      structures within these networks (e.g. amygdala, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex 
      [VLPFC]). In this review, we summarize the extant functional, functional 
      connectivity, and structural neuroimaging data in children and adolescents with GAD. 
      In addition, data concerning selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
      selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs), atypical 
      anxiolytics, benzodiazepines, and psychotherapy are reviewed in the context of the 
      neurophysiology of pediatric GAD. The existing data suggest abnormal activity within 
      the amygdala, VLPFC, and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the possibility of 
      impaired connectivity among these brain regions. In addition to numerous cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) trials, five randomized, controlled psychopharmacologic 
      trials primarily in youth with GAD suggest that SSRIs and SSNRIs are effective for 
      this condition. These findings also raise the possibility that functional activity 
      within the amygdala and VLPFC may be altered following successful treatment.

TI  - Predictors and moderators of treatment response in childhood anxiety disorders: 
      results from the CAMS trial.
PG  - 212-24
LID - 10.1037/a0035458 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes 
      among 488 youths ages 7-17 years (50% female; 74% ≤ 12 years) meeting Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; American Psychiatric 
      Association, 2000) criteria for diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, social 
      phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder who were randomly assigned to receive either 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or 
      medication management with pill placebo (PBO) in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety 
      Multimodal Study (CAMS). METHOD: Six classes of predictor and moderator variables 
      (22 variables) were identified from the literature and examined using continuous 
      (Pediatric Anxiety Ratings Scale; PARS) and categorical (Clinical Global Impression 
      Scale-Improvement; CGI-I) outcome measures. RESULTS: Three baseline variables 
      predicted better outcomes (independent of treatment condition) on the PARS, 
      including low anxiety severity (as measured by parents and independent evaluators) 
      and caregiver strain. No baseline variables were found to predict Week 12 responder 
      status (CGI-I). Participants' principal diagnosis moderated treatment outcomes but 
      only on the PARS. No baseline variables were found to moderate treatment outcomes on 
      Week 12 responder status (CGI-I). DISCUSSION: Overall, anxious children responded 
      favorably to CAMS treatments. However, having more severe and impairing anxiety, 
      greater caregiver strain, and a principal diagnosis of social phobia were associated 
      with less favorable outcomes. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - Understanding and treating panic disorder in the primary care setting.
PG  - 16-22
AB  - According to studies, the median prevalence of panic disorder in the primary care 
      setting is 4%. Rates are higher among certain patient populations, such as those 
      with cardiac (20% to 50%) or gastrointestinal presentations (28% to 40%). 
      Consequently, patients with panic disorder are high utilizers of medical services 
      and are heavily represented among patients classified as high health care utilizers, 
      compared with other psychiatric or non-psychiatric groups. Despite its frequency in 
      the primary care setting, panic disorder is significantly under-recognized by 
      medical providers. Corresponding with inadequate recognition is the substantial 
      proportion of these patients who fail to receive appropriate treatment 
      (pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy). Most experts have concluded that panic disorder 
      is poorly managed in the primary care setting because of the process of care and 
      patient engagement. In terms of process of care, primary care practice still 
      operates on an acute disease model (leaving no time for initial patient education or 
      follow-up), which is a poor fit for the management of chronic diseases. Insufficient 
      patient engagement in treatment (i.e., being involved in the treatment process, 
      "buying into" rationale for treatment, and being willing to collaborate with 
      clinician and adhere to recommendations) is the second important contributor to 
      inadequate treatment. Use of a chronic disease self-management approach would 
      enhance treatment of panic disorder. This model requires that patients, in 
      collaboration with the health care provider/system, take day-to-day responsibility 
      for managing their illness by doing 3 things: adhering to recommended medical 
      management, adopting improved health habits/coping skills, and assisting in ongoing 
      monitoring of illness status/change. Future approaches to treating panic disorder in 
      primary care would be enhanced by including assessments of patient beliefs and 
      preferences, spending more time in preparing the patient for treatment, utilizing a 
      simple pharmacotherapy algorithm, utilizing simple rating scales to monitor 
      outcomes, and training providers in brief CBT interventions.

TI  - A case of severe adolescent obsessive-compulsive disorder treated with inpatient 
      hospitalization, risperidone and sertraline.
PG  - 78-82
LID - 10.1556/JBA.1.2012.2.6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The initial treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has 
      generally been limited to serotonergic agents, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 
      or a combination of the two. These findings were supported by the POTS study for OCD 
      in children and adolescents. However, treatment with serotonergic agents or CBT can 
      take several weeks before benefit is seen; severe cases of OCD may require more 
      immediate treatment. CASE REPORT: The authors present a case of severe OCD in an 
      adolescent that required immediate treatment due to her critical medical condition. 
      The patient's symptoms included not eating or taking medications or fluids by mouth 
      due to fears of contamination. A medical hospitalization was previously required due 
      to dehydration. As treatment with an SSRI would not have quick enough onset and the 
      patient was initially resistant to participating in CBT, the patient was 
      psychiatrically hospitalized and first started on liquid risperidone. After several 
      doses of risperidone, the patient was able to participate in CBT and start 
      sertraline. DISCUSSION: The authors discuss the differential diagnosis of such a 
      patient, including the continuum of OCD symptoms and psychotic symptoms. The authors 
      discuss the different treatment options, including the utilization of inpatient 
      psychiatric hospitalization. The authors discuss the potential risks and benefits of 
      using atypical antipsychotics in lieu of benzodiazepines for the initial treatment 
      of severe adolescent OCD. The authors also discuss other current treatment 
      recommendations and rationale for the treatment that was pursued. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      patient received benefit of her symptoms relatively quickly with psychiatric 
      hospitalization and an atypical antipsychotic. The diagnosis of a psychotic disorder 
      should be considered. These treatment options must be weighed against the risks of 
      atypical antipsychotics, including extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, and 
      metabolic syndrome; benzodiazepines also have their risks and benefits. 
      Additionally, the cost of time and finances of inpatient hospitalization must be 
      considered. More research is needed regarding the short- and long-term efficacy and 
      safety of antipsychotics in the treatment of OCD in the child and adolescent 
      population.

AB  - This article provides an empirical review of the elements and efficacy of both 
      pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments for panic disorder. Both monotherapies and 
      combination treatment strategies are considered. The available evidence suggests 
      that both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy (prominently, 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake 
      inhibitors) are effective first-line agents and that CBT offers particular cost 
      efficacy relative to both pharmacotherapy alone and combined pharmacotherapy and 
      CBT. Predictors of non-response and mechanisms of action are considered, as are 
      novel treatment strategies, including the use of memory enhancers to improve CBT 
      outcome.

AB  - We designed and pilot-tested a group-based, work-related cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (WCBT) for unemployed individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). WCBT, 
      delivered in a vocational service setting by vocational service professionals, aims 
      to reduce social anxiety and enable individuals to seek, obtain, and retain 
      employment. We compared WCBT to a vocational services as usual control condition 
      (VSAU). Participants were unemployed, homeless, largely African American, vocational 
      service-seeking adults with SAD (N = 58), randomized to receive either eight 
      sessions of WCBT plus VSAU or VSAU alone and followed three months post-treatment. 
      Multilevel modeling revealed significantly greater reductions in social anxiety, 
      general anxiety, depression, and functional impairment for WCBT compared to VSAU. 
      Coefficients for job search activity and self-efficacy indicated greater increases 
      for WCBT. Hours worked per week in the follow-up period did not differ between the 
      groups, but small sample size and challenges associated with measuring work hours 
      may have contributed to this finding. Overall, the results of this study suggest 
      that unemployed persons with SAD can be effectively treated with specialized 
      work-related CBT administered by vocational service professionals. Future testing of 
      WCBT with a larger sample, a longer follow-up period, and adequate power to assess 
      employment outcomes is warranted.

TI  - A randomized effectiveness trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication for 
      primary care panic disorder.
PG  - 290-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder is a prevalent, often disabling condition among patients 
      in the primary care setting. Although numerous studies have assessed the 
      effectiveness of treatments for depression in primary care, few such studies have 
      been conducted for panic disorder. OBJECTIVE: To implement and test the 
      effectiveness of a combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral intervention 
      for panic disorder tailored to the primary care setting. DESIGN: Randomized, 
      controlled study comparing intervention to treatment as usual. SETTING: Six primary 
      care clinics associated with 3 university medical schools, serving an ethnically and 
      socioeconomically diverse patient population. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-two 
      primary care patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder. Comorbid mental 
      and physical disorders were permitted, provided these did not contraindicate the 
      treatment to be provided and were not acutely life threatening. INTERVENTION: 
      Patients were randomized to receive either treatment as usual or an intervention 
      consisting of a combination of up to 6 sessions (across 12 weeks) of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) modified for the primary care setting, with up to 
      6 follow-up telephone contacts during the next 9 months, and algorithm-based 
      pharmacotherapy provided by the primary care physician with guidance from a 
      psychiatrist. Behavioral health specialists, the majority inexperienced in CBT for 
      panic disorder, were trained to deliver the CBT and coordinated overall care, 
      including pharmacotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Proportion of subjects remitted 
      (no panic attacks in the past month, minimal anticipatory anxiety, and agoraphobia 
      subscale score <10 on Fear Questionnaire) and responding (Anxiety Sensitivity Index 
      score <20) and change over time in World Health Organization Disability Scale and 
      short form 12 scores. RESULTS: The combined cognitive-behavioral and 
      pharmacotherapeutic intervention resulted in sustained and gradually increasing 
      improvement relative to treatment as usual, with significantly higher rates at all 
      points of both the proportion of subjects remitted (3 months, 20% vs 12%; 12 months, 
      29% vs 16%) and responding (3 months, 46% vs 27%; 12 months, 63% vs 38%) and 
      significantly greater improvements in World Health Organization Disability Scale 
      (all points) and short form 12 mental health functioning (3 and 6 months) scores. 
      These effects were obtained in spite of similar rates of delivery of 
      guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy to the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Delivery of 
      evidence-based CBT and medication using the collaborative care model and a 
      CBT-naive, midlevel behavioral health specialist is feasible and significantly more 
      effective than usual care for primary care panic disorder.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of body dysmorphic disorder in adolescents.
PG  - 108-13
AB  - Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is an underrecognized and underdiagnosed problem that 
      is relatively common among adolescents. Although the onset of the disorder occurs in 
      adolescence, BDD research in child and adolescent psychiatry is relatively limited. 
      Body dysmorphic disorder has a high rate of co-morbidity with depression and 
      suicide, which indicates important implications for prompt diagnosis and treatment 
      in adolescents with BDD. Effective treatment options include cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). This 
      paper provides a brief overview of BDD in adolescents, presents and evaluates the 
      most recent literature on approaches to diagnosis and treatment, and highlights some 
      of the characteristics that distinguish BDD from other disorders such as 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, depression, and eating disorders.

TI  - Implications of naturalistic use of pharmacotherapy in CBT treatment for panic 
      disorder.
PG  - 1435-47
AB  - This study examined naturalistic medication use and cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) treatment outcomes in 105 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder 
      (PD), assessed by structured clinical interview. The association between pre- and 
      post-treatment use of SSRIs, benzodiazepines (BZs), and any anti-anxiety or 
      anti-depressant (A/D) medication were investigated for three indicators of treatment 
      outcome (PD severity, presence of agoraphobia (AG), anxiety sensitivity) at 
      post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Controlling for pre-treatment severity, 
      pre-treatment SSRI use was associated with worse outcomes for AG (p=.04) and anxiety 
      sensitivity (p=.047); post-treatment SSRI use was associated with delayed 
      improvements in PD severity (p=.05). Pre-treatment use of A/D was associated with 
      poorer PD severity outcomes (p=.04). Post-treatment use of A/D was associated with 
      higher anxiety sensitivity scores across post-treatment and 6-month follow-up 
      (p=.03). BZ use was not associated with significantly worse outcomes. However, there 
      was a decrease in the number of patients using BZs from pre-treatment to 
      post-treatment (p=.06) and follow-up (p=.006). In conclusion, controlling for 
      pre-treatment severity, pre- and post-treatment use of SSRIs and A/D was associated 
      with poorer outcomes, particularly for PD severity and anxiety sensitivity.

TI  - The role of psychotherapy in treating psychiatric disorders.
PG  - 617-29
AB  - Psychotherapy has shifted from long-term to short-term approaches, which have been 
      found to be effective for the treatment of specific psychiatric disorders. These 
      psychotherapy interventions (primarily behavior therapy, CBT, and IPT) have been 
      found useful in presenting an educational framework for disorders and the treatment 
      rationale for intervention programs. Short-term and maintenance empirical data 
      support the effectiveness of using behavior therapy and CBT as adjunctive 
      interventions with medications for bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia. In major 
      randomized clinical trials, psychotherapy interventions (primarily behavior therapy, 
      CBT, and IPT) have been shown to be effective as primary treatments (treatments of 
      choice) for the major psychiatric problems of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic 
      disorder, and major depression as well as several other psychiatric disorders. The 
      combination of psychotherapy and psychotropic medications is not always additive for 
      acute treatment effects or especially for the maintenance of treatment effects so 
      that the combination of psychotherapy and medications is not the most effective 
      treatment for all psychiatric disorders. Badly needed, additional randomized 
      controlled trials of psychotherapy, medications, and their combinations are under 
      way in large, NIMH-supported studies of the treatment of several psychiatric 
      disorders.

TI  - Do selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors enhance the efficacy of very brief 
      cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder? A pilot study.
PG  - 191-200
AB  - Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapies 
      (CBTs) are both considered as first-line treatments for panic disorder, but the 
      advantages of a combined therapy have yet to be definitively demonstrated. We 
      evaluated in this pilot study the effects of combining SSRIs (vs. a placebo) with a 
      very brief form of cognitive-behavioral therapy provided to all participants. 
      Thirty-three subjects with DSM-IV panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, were 
      randomized to receive either paroxetine or a placebo with flexible dosing (10-50 
      mg/day). Medication visits were brief (15 min), infrequent (6 in total) and 
      non-directive. An expert cognitive-behavior therapist administered one initial 
      45-min session and one subsequent 30-min session of very brief CBT (vbCBT) at weeks 
      5 and 7, respectively. Sessions were supplemented with educational and directive 
      reading materials. Patients in both groups (i.e. vbCBT+paroxetine; vbCBT+placebo) 
      improved similarly and substantially on most measures during the 10 weeks of acute 
      treatment. At week 10, the proportion of panic-free patients was significantly 
      higher in the paroxetine-treated group than in the placebo group (80 vs. 25%; 
      P<0.007), as was the proportion of subjects who rated themselves as 'very much 
      improved' at week 10 (60 vs. 13%; P<0.017). These findings point to the need for 
      additional studies to confirm the effectiveness of very brief forms of CBT, and to 
      document the circumstances in which combined treatment with an SSRI would be 
      warranted.

TI  - Importance of fear-avoidance behavior in chronic non-specific low back pain.
PG  - 87-95
LID - 10.3233/BMR-2010-0249 [doi]
AB  - International classification of Functioning, Disability and Health has adapted a 
      biopsychosocial model for management of chronic low back pain patient (CLBP). The 
      influence of psychological factors seems to be important in the transition from 
      acute to chronic low back pain (> 3 months). In particular, pain-related fear and 
      pain catastrophizing are believed to be important factors for disability. A number 
      of studies have shown that pain-related fear is a strong predictor of self-reported 
      disability in both acute and chronic low back pain. This situation has led to the 
      dependency of clinicians on radio-diagnostic procedures for decision making, which 
      often increases the financial burden. Research has evidenced that physicians and 
      physical therapists, often fail to recognize psychological illnesses. The aim of 
      this article is to describe the importance of fear avoidance behavior and to 
      evaluate the immediate effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) during 
      evaluation of patients with CLBP. An initial physical examination of a 24-year old 
      female patient with CLBP, showed painful guarded movements over the lumbo-pelvic 
      region, but the outcomes of her Fear-Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ) showed 
      strong cues for psychological illness. Based on clinical reasoning, the patient was 
      educated in terms of cognitive reconstruction. Interestingly after some CBT 
      sessions, her spine guarding pattern was disappeared and that helped us to carry a 
      more specific physical examination. After a few weekly therapeutic sessions of CBT, 
      significant changes were seen in all outcome measures. It has been concluded that 
      probably, by using specific biopsychosocial training, positive results in fear 
      avoidance behavior can be achieved. Hence the psychotherapeutic management approach 
      is considered as a useful economical tool in low back pain.

AB  - Patients with hypochondriasis are preoccupied with the fear or belief that they have 
      a serious, undiagnosed disease. This concern derives from misinterpretations of 
      benign physical sensations, and persists despite appropriate reassurance to the 
      contrary. They have, on average, disproportionately high rates of visits to 
      physicians, specialty consultations, laboratory tests, and surgical procedures, as 
      well as high health care costs. Despite this extensive medical attention, they find 
      their care unsatisfactory, which is understandable, as convincing alternative 
      explanations to their ailments are repeatedly delayed. Physicians, in turn, may feel 
      discouraged and frustrated in relation to these individuals where their best efforts 
      to help often prove ineffective or are even rejected. Recent scientific studies have 
      shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRI) are effective treatment options for health anxiety as demonstrated 
      in clinical trials.

PG  - 19-34
AB  - From a behaviour therapist's viewpoint anxiety is perceived in a framework expanded 
      to the psycho-neuro-immunological dimension. After describing phobic anxieties, 
      cognitive mechanisms, and allergic-immunological disturbances, clinical experience 
      won from 34 phobic patients treated with behavior therapy is demonstrated. 31 of 
      these proved to be poly-allergic. A comparison of both physiological fear and 
      allergic symptoms lets a relationship seem obvious between anaphylactic or collapse 
      inclination and psychological fear reaction. Mediated by cognitive variables persons 
      with emphatic perception may develop an association between anxiety and allergic 
      processes with high probability, the reciprocal influence of which can increase with 
      vehemence. Comprehensive psychologic-medical diagnostic and therapeutic measures 
      could improve the effectivity of therapy as well as anxious patients' "compliance" 
      and "coping skills".

      outcomes vary. One possible explanation is that patients employ cognitive 
      (experiential) avoidance during behavioural exposure. If so, reducing cognitive 
      avoidance during behavioural exposure should help. One option is interoceptive 
      exposure (IE), which involves sustained exposure (via attention) to pain sensations. 
      In order to test if IE could improve outcomes from behavioural exposure, this study 
      with mixed chronic pain patients compared outcomes from a cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT) pain management programme incorporating either IE or distraction from 
      pain. METHODS: One hundred forty chronic pain patients were randomly assigned to CBT 
      + IE or CBT + distraction. Outcome measures included pain, disability, depression 
      and medication. Measures reflecting degree of threat of pain were also employed 
      (catastrophizing, fear-avoidance, pain self-efficacy and pain acceptance). An 
      intention-to-treat approach, using mixed-effects model repeated measures, as well as 
      conventional inferential statistical tests, effect sizes and reliable change indices 
      were employed to evaluate the outcomes up to 1-year post-treatment. RESULTS: 
      Significant improvements were achieved by both treatment conditions on all outcome 
      measures and on measures reflecting the threatening nature of pain, with no 
      differences between treatment conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of IE to 
      behavioural exposure did not improve outcomes. However, higher adherence to either 
      attentional strategy was associated with larger effect sizes on all measures, 
      suggesting factors shared by the two treatments could have contributed to the 
      outcomes. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that increasing adherence to 
      treatment strategies, possibly by motivational measures, would improve the overall 
      outcomes of these interventions.

TI  - School-Based Treatment for Anxiety Research Study (STARS): a Randomized Controlled 
      Effectiveness Trial.
PG  - 407-417
LID - 10.1007/s10802-019-00596-5 [doi]
AB  - The current study compared the effectiveness of a school-clinician administered 
      cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) to treatment as usual (TAU) at post-treatment 
      (i.e., after 12 weeks) and at a 1 year follow-up. Sixty-two school-based clinicians 
      (37 in CBT; 25 in TAU) and 216 students (148 students in CBT; 68 in TAU) 
      participated. Students were ages 6-18 (mean age 10.87; 64% Caucasian & 29% African 
      American; 48.6% female) and all met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a primary anxiety 
      disorder. Independent evaluators (IEs) assessed clinical improvement, global 
      functioning, and loss of anxiety diagnoses; children and parents completed measures 
      of anxiety symptoms. At post-treatment, no significant treatment main effects 
      emerged on the primary outcome; 42% and 37% of youth were classified as treatment 
      responders in CBT and TAU respectively. However, parent-report of child anxiety 
      showed greater improvements in CBT relative to TAU (d = .29). Moderation analyses at 
      post-treatment indicated that older youth, those with social phobia and more severe 
      anxiety at baseline were more likely to be treatment responders in CBT compared to 
      TAU. At the 1 year follow-up, treatment gains were maintained but no treatment group 
      differences or moderators emerged. CBT and TAU for pediatric anxiety disorders, when 
      delivered by school clinicians were generally similar in effectiveness for lowering 
      anxiety and improving functioning at both post-treatment (on all but the parent 
      measure and for specific subgroups) and 1 year follow-up. Implications for 
      disseminating CBT in the school setting are discussed.

TI  - Further Exploration of Treatment Response in Latinos with Comorbid Asthma and Panic 
      Disorder: A Brief Report of HRV and ETCO2 as Potential Mediators of Treatment 
      Response.
PG  - 67-74
LID - 10.1007/s10484-020-09454-3 [doi]
AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) and end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) in relation to treatment 
      response have not been studied in Latino populations or in comorbid asthma and panic 
      disorder (PD). An extension of previously published research, the current study 
      explored psychophysiological variables as possible mediators of treatment response. 
      Latino treatment completers (N = 32) in the Bronx with asthma-PD received either 
      Cognitive-Behavioral Psychophysiological Therapy (CBPT) or Music Relaxation Therapy 
      (MRT). CBPT included HRV-biofeedback (HRVB); in-the-moment heart rate data to help 
      an individual learn to influence his/her own heart rate. The sample was primarily 
      female (93.8%) and Puerto Rican (81.25%). Treatment groups did not differ on 
      demographics, except for less education in CBPT. The Panic Disorder Severity Scale 
      (PDSS) and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) assessed changes in symptoms. HRV and 
      ETCO2 were measured at four of eight therapy sessions. Baseline ETCO2 and changes in 
      HRV from first to last of psychophysiology sessions were investigated as mediators 
      of change on ACQ and PDSS. Mixed model analyses indicated in the CPBT group, changes 
      in both asthma control and PD severity were not mediated by changes in HRV. In the 
      CBPT and MRT groups combined, changes in PD severity were not mediated by baseline 
      ETCO2. These findings may be due to the brevity of HRVB in CBPT, multiple treatment 
      components, ETCO2 not directly targeted, and/or unique physiological pathways in 
      Latinos with asthma-PD.

AB  - Fear extinction learning is a highly adaptive process that involves the integrity of 
      frontolimbic circuitry. Its disruption has been associated with emotional 
      dysregulation in stress and anxiety disorders. In this article we consider how age, 
      genetics and experiences shape our capacity to regulate fear in cross-species 
      studies. Evidence for adolescent-specific diminished fear extinction learning is 
      presented in the context of immature frontolimbic circuitry. We also present 
      evidence for less neural plasticity in fear regulation as a function of early-life 
      stress and by genotype, focusing on the common brain derived neurotrophin factor 
      (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism. Finally, we discuss this work in the context of 
      exposure-based behavioral therapies for the treatment of anxiety and stress 
      disorders that are based on principles of fear extinction. We conclude by 
      speculating on how such therapies may be optimized for the individual based on the 
      patient's age, genetic profile and personal history to move from standard treatment 
      of care to personalized and precision medicine.

TI  - Next-step strategies for panic disorder refractory to initial pharmacotherapy: a 
      3-phase randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 1563-70
LID - 10.4088/JCP.08m04485blu [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: More data are needed to guide next-step interventions for panic disorder 
      refractory to initial intervention. METHOD: This 24-week randomized clinical trial 
      (RCT) enrolled 46 patients with DSM-IV-defined panic disorder from November 2000 to 
      April 2005 and consisted of 3 phases. Patients who failed to meet remission criteria 
      were eligible for randomization in the next treatment phase. Phase 1 was a 6-week 
      lead-in with open-label sertraline flexibly dosed to 100 mg (or escitalopram 
      equivalent) to prospectively define treatment refractoriness (lack of remission). 
      Phase 2 was a 6-week double-blind RCT of (1) increased-dose selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) versus (2) continued SSRI plus placebo. Phase 3 was a 
      12-week RCT of added cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to "medication 
      optimization" with SSRI plus clonazepam. Primary endpoints were remission and change 
      in Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score in the intent-to-treat sample in each 
      phase. RESULTS: In phase 1, 20.5% (8/39) of the patients achieved remission, and 
      only baseline severity predicted endpoint PDSS score (beta [SE] = 1.04 [0.15], t = 
      6.76, P < .001). In phase 2, increasing the SSRI dose did not result in greater 
      improvement or remission rates (placebo 15% [n = 2] vs increased dose 9% [n = 1]: 
      Fisher exact test P = NS). In phase 3, remission was minimal (medication 
      optimization = 11% [n = 1]; CBT = 10% [n = 1]), with a lack of group difference in 
      PDSS score reduction (t(17) = 0.51, P > .60) consistent with a small effect size (d 
      = 0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Although power was limited and larger studies are needed, we 
      failed to find evidence for greater benefit of increased SSRI dose versus 
      continuation of current dose for panic disorder symptomatic after 6 weeks at 
      moderate dose. Further, augmentation with CBT or medication optimization with 
      clonazepam augmentation in nonremitted panic after 12 weeks of an SSRI did not 
      differ, suggesting that both are reasonable next-step options. However, low overall 
      remission rates in this comorbid refractory population suggest that better 
      predictors of response to specific treatments over time and additional interventions 
      are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00118417.

TI  - Behavioral interventions for office-based care: stress and anxiety disorders.
PG  - 28-40
AB  - Numerous behavioral therapies have been investigated in the management of anxiety- 
      and stress-related disorders. There is strong evidence to support cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) in the management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 
      posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and 
      social phobias. Adjunctive behavioral sleep intervention may enhance results for 
      GAD, and initiation of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for GAD before CBT 
      also may enhance response. Several randomized clinical trials showed benefit of 
      Internet-based CBT for GAD, but additional studies are needed before conclusions can 
      be drawn regarding its effectiveness for posttraumatic stress disorder. Although 
      outcome data are limited, family physicians can offer patients screening for anxiety 
      disorders, psychological first aid (ie, listening to and comforting patients, 
      teaching about emotional and physiologic responses to traumatic incidents, and 
      encouraging engagement with social supports and coping) after trauma, education 
      about anxiety disorders, and referral to evidence-based self-help resources. Family 
      physicians also can ensure linkage with behavioral health care physicians and 
      encourage adherence to self-help protocols.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) added to specialist medical care 
      (SMC), or graded exercise therapy (GET) added to SMC, are more effective in reducing 
      fatigue and improving physical function than both adaptive pacing therapy (APT) plus 
      SMC and SMC alone for chronic fatigue syndrome. We investigate putative treatment 
      mechanisms. METHODS: We did a planned secondary mediation analysis of the PACE trial 
      comparing SMC alone or SMC plus APT with SMC plus CBT and SMC plus GET for patients 
      with chronic fatigue syndrome. 641 participants were recruited from six specialist 
      chronic fatigue syndrome clinics in the UK National Health Service between March 18, 
      2005, and Nov 28, 2008. We assessed mediation using the product of coefficients 
      method with the 12 week measure of the mediators and the 52 week measure of the 
      outcomes. The primary outcomes were fatigue measured by the Chalder fatigue scale 
      and physical function measured by the physical function subscale of the SF-36. We 
      included confounder covariates and used treatment by mediator interaction terms to 
      examine differences in mediator-outcome relations by treatment group. FINDINGS: The 
      largest mediated effect for both CBT and GET and both primary outcomes was through 
      fear avoidance beliefs with an effect of larger magnitude for GET (standardised 
      effects ×10, CBT vs APT, fatigue -1.22, 95% CI -0.52 to -1.97, physical function 
      1.54, 0.86 to 2.31; GET vs APT, fatigue -1.86, -0.80 to -2.89, physical function 
      2.35, 1.35 to 3.39). Increase in exercise tolerance (6 min walk distance) was a 
      potent mediator of the effect of GET (vs APT, fatigue -1.37, 95% CI -0.76 to -2.21, 
      physical function 1.90, 1.10 to 2.91), but not CBT. INTERPRETATION: Our main finding 
      was that fear avoidance beliefs were the strongest mediator for both CBT and GET. 
      Changes in both beliefs and behaviour mediated the effects of both CBT and GET, but 
      more so for GET. The results support a treatment model in which both beliefs and 
      behaviour play a part in perpetuating fatigue and disability in chronic fatigue 
      syndrome. FUNDING: UK Medical Research Council, Department of Health for England,

TI  - Aerobic exercise training facilitates the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral 
      therapy in panic disorder.
PG  - 221-8
LID - 10.1002/da.22337 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity has been discussed as a therapeutic alternative or 
      add-on for the treatment of anxiety disorders. We studied whether aerobic exercise 
      compared to physical activity with low impact can improve the effect of cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with panic disorder (PD) with/without 
      agoraphobia. METHODS: Forty-seven patients received group CBT treatment over 1 
      month, which was augmented with an 8-week protocol of either aerobic exercise (three 
      times/week, 30 min, 70% VO(2) max; n = 24) or a training program including exercises 
      with very low intensity (n = 23) in a randomized controlled double-blind design. The 
      primary outcome measure was the total score on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (Ham-A). A 
      2 × 3 analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline value as a covariate was 
      conducted for data analysis. RESULTS: Time × group interaction for the Ham-A 
      revealed a significant effect (P = .047, η(2) p = .072), which represented the 
      significant group difference at a 7-month follow-up. For the other clinical outcome 
      measures no statistical significance emerged, although improvement was more 
      sustained in the exercise group. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with PD, regular aerobic 
      exercise adds an additional benefit to CBT. This supports previous results and 
      provides evidence about the intensity of exercise that needs to be performed.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy in paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder: a naturalistic, 
      retrospective study.
PG  - 241-52

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can cause substantial 
      impairment in academic, social and family functioning. Even though 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, the pharmacological 
      option has to be taken into consideration. Effectiveness of serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SRIs) has been supported by several double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      studies. OBJECTIVE: To report the response to pharmacotherapy in children and 
      adolescents with OCD naturalistically followed up and treated with SRIs. METHODS: 
      From a consecutive series of 257 patients (174 males and 83 females; mean age 
      13.6+/-2.7 years) diagnosed with OCD following a clinical interview according to 
      DSM-IV criteria, 37 children improved significantly after psychotherapy and were 
      excluded. The remaining 220 patients were included in the study. RESULTS: 
      Eighty-nine patients (40.5%) were managed with SRI monotherapy and 131 with an SRI 
      in combination with another medication. Compared with those who needed polypharmacy, 
      patients managed with SRI monotherapy were younger at the time of the first 
      consultation, had less severe symptoms at baseline, and more frequently presented 
      with co-occurring anxiety and depressive disorders, while patients receiving 
      polypharmacy presented with higher rates of bipolar disorder, tic disorder and 
      disruptive behaviour disorders. 135 patients (61.4%) achieved a positive clinical 
      response and were considered responders. When differences between responders and 
      nonresponders at the end of follow-up were considered, irrespective of the 
      pharmacological treatment (monotherapy or polypharmacy), responders had less severe 
      disease at baseline, were younger at the time of the first consultation, more 
      frequently presented with the contamination/cleaning phenotype and less frequently 
      presented with the hoarding phenotype. Treatment refractoriness was associated with 
      higher rates of conduct disorder and bipolar disorder, and lower rates of 
      generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Forty-three children received 
      therapy with an atypical antipsychotic as an augmenting strategy, and 25 of these 
      children (58.1%) became responders. Responders to augmentation were less severely 
      impaired at baseline, while different subtypes of OCD were similar between 
      responders and nonresponders, as were patterns of co-morbidity. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study suggests that putative variables associated with response to pharmacological 
      treatment of paediatric OCD can be defined, and can help improve treatment 
      strategies.

TI  - Group therapy in public mental health services: approaches, patients and group 
      therapists.
PG  - 219-25
LID - 10.1111/jpm.12072 [doi]
AB  - Group therapy is used extensively within public mental health services, but more 
      detailed knowledge is needed. All 25 health authorities in Norway were invited to 
      describe their groups: theory, primary tasks, interventions, structure, patients and 
      therapists. Four hundred twenty-six groups, 296 in community mental health centres 
      and 130 in hospitals, were categorized into nine types, based on theoretical 
      background. Psychodynamic groups were most frequent, followed by 
      cognitive-behavioural, psycho-educative, social skills/coping and art/expressive 
      groups. Weekly sessions of 90 min and treatment duration <6 or >12 months was most 
      frequent. Main diagnosis for 2391 patients: depression (517), personality disorder 
      (396), schizophrenia/psychosis (313) and social phobia (249). Patients with 
      depression or personality disorder were mostly in psychodynamic groups, 
      psychosis/bipolar disorder in psycho-educative groups. Cognitive-behavioural groups 
      were used across several diagnoses. Most therapists were nurses, only 50% had a 
      formal training in group therapy. There is a plethora of groups, some based on one 
      theoretical school, while others integrate theory from several 'camps'. Patients 
      with similar diagnosis were offered different group approaches, although some trends 
      existed. More research evidence from regular clinical groups is needed, and 
      clinician-researcher networks should be developed. More group therapists with formal 
      training are needed.

TI  - Nulliparous pregnant women's narratives of imminent childbirth before and after 
      internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy for severe fear of childbirth: a 
      qualitative study.
PG  - 1259-65
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.13358 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the expectations concerning imminent childbirth before and 
      after 8 weeks of internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) among 
      nulliparous pregnant women with severe fear of childbirth. DESIGN: Qualitative study 
      of nulliparous pregnant women's narratives before and after CBT. SETTING: The first 
      ICBT programme for treating severe fear of childbirth. SAMPLE: Fifteen nulliparous 
      pregnant Swedish women with severe fear of childbirth participating in an ICBT 
      self-help programme. METHODS: Semi-structured open-ended questions over the internet 
      before and after 8 weeks of ICBT. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The participants' narratives pertaining to five different 
      situations during labour and delivery before and after ICBT. RESULTS: After therapy, 
      participants described a more realistic attitude towards imminent childbirth, more 
      self-confidence and more active coping strategies. They perceived their partners and 
      the staff as more supportive. They were more aware of the approaching meeting with 
      their baby when giving birth. CONCLUSIONS: Following the ICBT programme, 
      participants changed their attitude towards imminent childbirth from negative to 
      more positive. This was manifested in positive and more realistic expectations 
      regarding themselves, their partner and the staff that would look after them.

TI  - Attitudes towards exercise among substance using older adults living with HIV and 
      chronic pain.

AB  - Chronic pain and substance use disorders occur commonly among HIV-infected persons. 
      Recent CDC guidelines recommend non-pharmacologic approaches over opioid medications 
      for the management of chronic pain. This is particularly relevant for persons with 
      substance use disorders. Structured physical activity may be an effective strategy 
      for pain reduction. We developed a combined cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) + exercise intervention to reduce pain, pain-related disability and substance 
      use and improve physical function in older HIV-infected adults with chronic pain and 
      substance use. We employed established CBT protocols for the intervention, and 
      sought feedback from potential end users when developing the exercise component of 
      the intervention. A total of 27 HIV-infected adults ≥ 50 years of age participated 
      in four focus group sessions. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. 
      Participant demographics: mean age 54 years; male 81%; Hispanic 48%, Black 33%; 
      treated for substance abuse in the past 52%. Exercise was seen as a desirable 
      activity, but many participants expressed barriers to exercise including fear of 
      pain exacerbation, low physical fitness, and lack of availability of perceived safe 
      spaces for HIV-infected persons. Most participants were receptive to exercise for 
      pain reduction, particularly modalities that provide added psychological benefits of 
      reducing stress and anxiety. Exercise for pain management among older HIV-infected 
      adults with chronic pain and substance use was found to be highly acceptable. 
      However, interventions need to be tailored to the unique needs of this population to 
      address their fears and concerns.

TI  - Amygdala response predicts trajectory of symptom reduction during Trauma-Focused 
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy among adolescent girls with PTSD.

AB  - Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is the gold standard treatment 
      for pediatric PTSD. Nonetheless, clinical outcomes in TF-CBT are highly variable, 
      indicating a need to identify reliable predictors that allow forecasting treatment 
      response. Here, we test the hypothesis that functional neuroimaging correlates of 
      emotion processing predict PTSD symptom reduction during Trauma-Focused 
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among adolescent girls with PTSD. Thirty-four 
      adolescent girls with PTSD related to physical or sexual assault were enrolled in 
      TF-CBT, delivered in an approximately 12 session format, in an open trial. Prior to 
      treatment, they were engaged in an implicit threat processing task during 3T fMRI, 
      during which they viewed faces depicting fearful or neutral expressions. Among 
      adolescent girls completing TF-CBT (n = 23), slopes of PTSD symptom trajectories 
      during TF-CBT were significantly related to pre-treatment degree of bilateral 
      amygdala activation while viewing fearful vs neutral images. Adolescents with less 
      symptom reduction were characterized by greater amygdala activation to both threat 
      and neutral images (i.e., less threat-safety discrimination), whereas adolescents 
      with greater symptom reduction were characterized by amygdala activation only to 
      threat images. These clinical outcome relationships with pre-treatment bilateral 
      amygdala activation remained when controlling for possible confounding demographic 
      or clinical variables (e.g., concurrent psychotropic medication, comorbid 
      diagnoses). While limited by a lack of a control group, these preliminary results 
      suggest that pre-treatment amygdala reactivity to fear stimuli, a component of 
      neurocircuitry models of PTSD, positively predicts symptom reduction during TF-CBT 
      among assaulted adolescent girls, providing support for an objective measure for 
      forecasting treatment response in this vulnerable population.

PG  - 119-28
LID - 10.1007/s40211-013-0065-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anorexic girls have difficulties in handling their emotions. We examined 
      emotional problems of adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa (AN) during the course 
      of cognitive behavioral group therapy (G-CBT). METHODS: Overall, 29 girls with AN 
      (age 13-17 years) participated in four groups of manual based G-CBT. We assessed the 
      body mass index (BMI), eating behavior psychopathology, emotions, depression, 
      hedonistic activities, self-care and-efficacy, social phobia, sense of coherence 
      (SOC), and alexithymia before, during and up to 1 year after therapy. RESULTS: Out 
      of 29, 16 (55 %, intent to treat, or 76 %, per protocol) girls were successfully 
      treated, 5 (17 or 24 %) had a "poor outcome", and 8 (28 %) dropped out. BMI, eating 
      behavior, mood, social anxiety, self-care, and self-efficacy persistently improved. 
      Anorexic girls had multiple emotional deficits, low self-confidence, and exaggerated 
      needs of control and of being accepted. Emotional deficits were resistant to change. 
      Hedonistic activities, social skills, and recovery from depression were positive, 
      comorbid disorders and parental psychopathology negative prognostic factors.

TI  - Therapist-youth agreement on alliance change predicts long-term outcome in CBT for 
      anxiety disorders.
PG  - 625-32
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12485 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for youth anxiety 
      disorders, it is unclear whether, and from whose perspective, the alliance predicts 
      outcome. We examined whether youth- and therapist-rated alliance, including level of 
      youth-therapist alliance agreement, predicted outcome in a randomized controlled 
      trial. METHODS: Youth (N = 91, M age = 11.4 years (SD = 2.1), 49.5% boys, 86.8% 
      Caucasian) diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, or generalized 
      anxiety disorder drawn from the ICBT condition of an effectiveness trial were 
      treated with an ICBT program. Youth- and therapist-rated alliance ratings, assessed 
      with the Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children (TASC-C/T), were collected 
      following session 3 (early) and 7 (late). Early alliance, change in alliance from 
      early to late, and level of youth-therapist agreement on early alliance and alliance 
      change were examined, in relation to outcomes collected at posttreatment and 1-year 
      follow-up. Outcome was defined as primary diagnosis loss and reduction in 
      clinicians' severity ratings (CSR; Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule; ADIS-C/P) 
      based on youth- and parent-report at posttreatment and follow-up, and youth 
      treatment satisfaction collected at posttreatment (Client Satisfaction Scale; CSS). 
      RESULTS: Early TASC-C scores positively predicted treatment satisfaction at 
      posttreatment. Higher levels of agreement on change in TASC-C and TASC-T scores 
      early to late in treatment predicted diagnosis loss and CSR reduction at follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Only the level of agreement in alliance change predicted follow-up 
      outcomes in ICBT for youth anxiety disorders. The findings support further 
      examination of the role that youth-therapist alliance discrepancies may play in 
      promoting positive outcomes in ICBT for youth anxiety disorders. Clinical trial

TI  - Generalized anxiety disorder in children and adolescents.
PG  - 139-53
AB  - Children and adolescents with GAD suffer from excessive, pervasive worries that 
      interfere with social, academic, and family functioning. The comorbidity rate with 
      other anxiety disorders and major depression is high. The course tends to be 
      chronic, and evidence shows continuity between anxiety disorders in youth and 
      adulthood. Individual and group CBT and the incorporation of family anxiety 
      management training have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of childhood GAD. No 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmacotherapy trials with adequate sample sizes 
      for children and adolescents with GAD have been published. Preliminary data support 
      the potential efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, buspirone, and 
      high-potency benzodiazepines. Adequately powered, controlled, pharmacologic 
      treatment trials are necessary. Future research should be directed toward comparing 
      the relative efficacy of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and both in the treatment 
      of GAD in youth.

TI  - Resting-state connectivity of the amygdala predicts response to cognitive behavioral 
      therapy in obsessive compulsive disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder which is 
      characterized by recurrent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and ritualized, 
      repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). The gold standard for the 
      treatment of OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response 
      prevention. This is the first study exploring the predictive value of resting-state 
      functional connectivity for the outcome of CBT. METHODS: We assessed whole-brain 
      resting-state functional connectivity in a group of 17 un-medicated OCD inpatients 
      prior to CBT compared to 19 healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging. The graph theoretical metric degree centrality served as indicator for 
      altered voxel-wise whole-brain functional connectivity. The relative change in the 
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score was used to evaluate treatment 
      outcome. RESULTS: The degree centrality of the right basolateral nuclei group of the 
      amygdala was positively correlated with the response to subsequent CBT. OCD patients 
      showed a lower degree centrality of the superficial amygdala (bilateral). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that two different sub-regions of the amygdala and 
      their respective neural networks are affected in OCD: the superficial amygdala and 
      networks related to evaluation of reinforcers and risk anticipation and the 
      basolateral amygdala which is implicated in fear processing. The diminished CBT 
      response in patients showing a lower degree centrality of the basolateral amygdala 
      reflects a deficient fear circuit in these patients which may impact fear extinction 
      as a core mechanism of exposure-based CBT.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of Practice Team-Supported Exposure Training for Panic Disorder 
      and Agoraphobia in Primary Care: a Cluster-Randomized Trial.
PG  - 1120-1126
LID - 10.1007/s11606-020-05658-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care is the main treatment setting for panic disorder and should 
      be supplemented by collaborative care programs. However, shortage of mental health 
      professionals prevents collaborative care programs from being effectively 
      implemented. The PARADISE study showed the efficacy of a self-managed, 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-oriented exposure training for patients with 
      panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care delivered by the family 
      practice team. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the PARADISE 
      intervention. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective 
      based on data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial over a time horizon of 
      12 months. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred nineteen adult panic disorder patients with or 
      without agoraphobia. INTERVENTIONS: A self-managed, CBT-oriented exposure training 
      for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care 
      delivered by the primary care practice team in comparison to routine care. MAIN 
      MEASURES: Total costs from the societal perspective. Direct costs and 
      disease-specific costs. Quality-adjusted life years based on the EQ-5D-3L. 
      Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. 
      KEY RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group caused lower costs (mean, €1017; 95% 
      confidence interval [-€3306; €1272]; p = 0.38) and gained on average more QALY 
      (mean, 0.034 QALY (95% confidence interval [0.005; 0.062]; p = 0.02). Therefore, the 
      intervention dominated the control treatment. The probability of cost-effectiveness 
      of the intervention at a willingness-to-pay margin of €50,000 per QALY was 96%. 
      Results from supplementary analyses considering direct or disease-specific costs 
      instead of total costs showed comparable results. CONCLUSION: The PARADISE 
      intervention is cost effective. This conclusion is valid for total costs, generic 
      health care (direct) costs, disease-specific health care costs. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Facing your fears in adolescence: cognitive-behavioral therapy for high-functioning

AB  - Adolescents with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are at high risk 
      for developing psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety disorders among the most commonly 
      cooccurring. Cognitive behavior therapies (CBTs) are considered the best practice 
      for treating anxiety in the general population. Modified CBT approaches for youth 
      with high-functioning ASD and anxiety have resulted in significant reductions in 
      anxiety following intervention. The purpose of the present study was to develop an 
      intervention for treating anxiety in adolescents with ASD based on a CBT program 
      designed for school-aged children. The Facing Your Fears-Adolescent Version (FYF-A) 
      program was developed; feasibility and acceptability data were obtained, along with 
      initial efficacy of the intervention. Twenty-four adolescents, aged 13-18, completed 
      the FYF-A intervention. Results indicated significant reductions in anxiety severity 
      and interference posttreatment, with low rates of anxiety maintained at 3-month 
      follow-up. In addition, nearly 46% of teen participants met criteria for a positive 
      treatment response on primary diagnosis following the intervention. Initial findings 
      from the current study are encouraging and suggest that modified group CBT for 
      adolescents with high-functioning ASD may be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms. 
      Limitations include small sample size and lack of control group. Future directions 
      are discussed.

TI  - Medial prefrontal cortex stimulation modulates the processing of conditioned fear.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00044 [doi]
LID - 44
AB  - The extinction of conditioned fear depends on an efficient interplay between the 
      amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In rats, high-frequency electrical 
      mPFC stimulation has been shown to improve extinction by means of a reduction of 
      amygdala activity. However, so far it is unclear whether stimulation of homologues 
      regions in humans might have similar beneficial effects. Healthy volunteers received 
      one session of either active or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (rTMS) covering the mPFC while undergoing a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction 
      paradigm. Repetitive TMS was applied offline after fear acquisition in which one of 
      two faces (CS+ but not CS-) was associated with an aversive scream (UCS). Immediate 
      extinction learning (day 1) and extinction recall (day 2) were conducted without UCS 
      delivery. Conditioned responses (CR) were assessed in a multimodal approach using 
      fear-potentiated startle (FPS), skin conductance responses (SCR), functional 
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and self-report scales. Consistent with the 
      hypothesis of a modulated processing of conditioned fear after high-frequency rTMS, 
      the active group showed a reduced CS+/CS- discrimination during extinction learning 
      as evident in FPS as well as in SCR and arousal ratings. FPS responses to CS+ 
      further showed a linear decrement throughout both extinction sessions. This study 
      describes the first experimental approach of influencing conditioned fear by using 
      rTMS and can thus be a basis for future studies investigating a complementation of 
      mPFC stimulation to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

TI  - Does cognitive-behavioral therapy response among adults with obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder differ as a function of certain comorbidities?
PG  - 547-52
LID - 10.1016/j.janxdis.2010.03.013 [doi]
AB  - This study examines the impact of several of the most common comorbid psychiatric 
      disorders (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); major depressive disorder 
      (MDD); social phobia, and panic disorder) on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      response in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). One hundred and 
      forty-three adults with OCD (range=18-79 years) received 14 sessions of weekly or 
      intensive CBT. Assessments were conducted before and after treatment. Primary 
      outcomes included scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), 
      response rates, and remission status. Sixty-nine percent of participants met 
      criteria for at least one comorbid diagnosis. Although baseline OCD severity was 
      slightly higher among individuals with OCD+MDD and OCD+GAD (in comparison to those 
      with OCD-only), neither the presence nor the number of pre-treatment comorbid 
      disorders predicated symptom severity, treatment response, remission, or clinically 
      significant change rates at post-treatment. These data suggest that CBT for OCD is 
      robust to the presence of certain common Axis-I comorbidities.

TI  - Extinction of panicogenic effects of a 35% CO2 challenge in patients with panic 
      disorder.
PG  - 630-8
AB  - Inhalations of high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) reliably produce panic 
      attacks in patients with panic disorder. The present study evaluated whether 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for panic disorder would extinguish CO2-induced 
      panic and whether changes in panic and arousal-related cognitions were associated 
      with the induction of panic. Patients with panic disorder (N = 54) were assigned to 
      1 of 3 experimental conditions: CBT with respiratory training (CBT-R), CBT without 
      respiratory training (CBT), or delayed treatment. Participants received 5 repeated 
      vital-capacity inhalations of 35% CO2/65% O2 prior to and following either 12 
      treatment sessions or a 12-week waiting period. During pretreatment assessments, 74% 
      of patients experienced a panic attack during at least 1 inhalation. At 
      posttreatment, only 20% of treated participants (CBT-R = 19%, CBT = 22%), compared 
      with 64% of untreated participants, panicked. Forty-four percent of treated 
      participants, compared with 0% of untreated participants, reported no anxiety during 
      all posttreatment inhalations. Anxiety sensitivity as well as panic appraisals 
      regarding the likelihood of panic and self-efficacy with coping with panic were 
      significantly related to fearful responding to the CO2 challenge.

TI  - Treatment of nulliparous women with severe fear of childbirth via the Internet: a 
      feasibility study.
PG  - 37-43
LID - 10.3109/0167482X.2016.1140143 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to test the feasibility of Internet 
      interventions among nulliparous women suffering from severe fear of childbirth (FOC) 
      by means of an Internet-delivered therapist-supported self-help program based on 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. 
      SETTING: A feasibility study of an ICBT program for the treatment of severe FOC in 
      pregnant women. SAMPLE: Twenty-eight Swedish-speaking nulliparous women with severe 
      FOC recruited via a project home page from January 2012 to December 2013. METHODS: 
      The main components of the ICBT program for the treatment of severe FOC comprised 
      psycho-education, breathing retraining, cognitive restructuring, imaginary exposure, 
      in vivo exposure and relapse prevention. The study participants were anonymously 
      self-recruited over the Internet, interviewed by telephone and then enrolled. All 
      participants were offered 8 weeks of treatment via the Internet. Participants 
      reported their homework weekly, submitted measurements of their fear and received 
      feedback from a therapist via a secure online contact management system. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Level of FOC measured with the Wijma Delivery 
      Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ A) during screening at enrollment and 
      weekly during the treatment (W-DEQ version A), and after the delivery (W-DEQ version 
      B). RESULTS: A statistically significant (p < 0.0005) decrease of FOC [W-DEQ sum 
      score decreased pre to post-therapy, with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.95)]. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this feasibility study suggest that ICBT has potential 
      in the treatment of severe FOC during pregnancy in motivated nulliparous women. The 
      results need to be confirmed by randomized controlled studies.

      in adolescents: a randomized controlled trial from Pakistan.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1017/S1352465820000284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety is common among adolescents in Pakistan and is associated 
      with low self-esteem. Among the recommended treatments, cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT) is effective, and self-help approaches are encouraged. AIM: To 
      determine the effectiveness of culturally adapted CBT-based guided self-help 
      (CACBT-GSH) intervention, using a manual 'Khushi aur Khatoon', for treating social 
      anxiety when added to treatment as usual (TAU) compared with TAU only. METHOD: A 
      total of 76 adolescents with social anxiety aged 13-16 years from six schools in 
      Multan, Pakistan were recruited into this randomized controlled trial. Participants 
      were divided into intervention and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. Social anxiety, 
      self-esteem and fear of negative evaluation were assessed through the Liebowtiz 
      Social Anxiety Scale for children and adolescents, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale 
      and the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation, respectively, at baseline and at the end 
      of the study. Guided self-help using culturally adapted CBT (CACBT)-based self-help 
      manual (eight sessions, one session per week) was provided to the intervention 
      group. The effect of the CACBT-GSH intervention was analysed with ANCOVA. RESULTS: 
      There was a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the 
      control groups in favour of intervention. Participants in the intervention group 
      showed reduced symptoms of social anxiety (p < .001), fear of negative evaluation (p 
      < .001) and enhanced self-esteem (p < .001). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the 
      effectiveness of CACBT-based guided self-help intervention in treating social 
      anxiety and addressing the symptoms associated with it.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of cognitive behavioural therapy and inhalation sedation 
      on child dental anxiety.
PG  - 173-9
LID - 10.1007/s40368-014-0152-x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To compare the effectiveness of inhalation sedation with nitrous oxide/oxygen 
      (N2O/O2) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in reducing dental anxiety in 
      preschool children. STUDY DESIGN: Randomised controlled clinical trial. METHODS: 
      This study was conducted on 45 preschoolers with moderate to severe dental anxiety 
      (determined by the Children's Fear Survey Schedule Dental Subscale), who required 
      pulp treatment of at least one primary mandibular molar. Baseline anxiety and 
      cooperation levels were determined using Venham Clinical Anxiety and Cooperation 
      Scales (VCAS and VCCS) and Venham Picture Test (VPT) at the first dental visit 
      (dental prophylaxis and fluoride treatment). Before the second dental visit (pulp 
      treatment), the children were randomly assigned to one of three groups--1: control, 
      2: N(2)O/O(2) and 3: CBT. In group 1, the usual behaviour management techniques were 
      used, in group 2, nitrous oxide/oxygen gas was used and in group 3, unrelated play, 
      Benson's breathing and positive self-talk and modelling were used. Anxiety and 
      cooperation levels were determined at three periods: injection, rubber dam placement 
      and the application of a high-speed handpiece with VCAS and VCCS and VPT. Finally, 
      anxiety and cooperation differences between the two dental visits were compared 
      within the three groups. STATISTICS: Chi square, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis and 
      Mann-Whitney U tests were used. RESULTS: N(2)O/O(2) and CBT significantly resulted 
      in lower anxiety and higher cooperation in the second visit (at all three periods) 
      compared to the control, although there was no significant difference between these 
      two treatment methods. CONCLUSION: Both test methods were effective in reducing 
      dental anxiety in preschoolers. Considering the adverse effects and necessity of 
      equipment and trained personnel when using nitrous oxide and oxygen inhalation 
      sedation, cognitive behavioural therapy is preferable because of its better 
      applicability.

TI  - Does occasional cannabis use impact anxiety and depression treatment outcomes?: 
      Results from a randomized effectiveness trial.
PG  - 392-8
AB  - This study investigated the extent to which occasional cannabis use moderated 
      anxiety and depression outcomes in the Collaborative Care for Anxiety and Panic 
      (CCAP) study, a combined cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy 
      randomized effectiveness trial. Participants were 232 adults from six 
      university-based primary care outpatient clinics in three West Coast cities 
      randomized to receive either the CCAP intervention or the usual care condition. 
      Results showed significant (P<.01) evidence of an interaction between treatment 
      group (CCAP vs. usual care) and cannabis use status (monthly vs. less than monthly) 
      for depressive symptoms, but not for panic disorder or social phobia symptoms (all 
      P>.05). Monthly cannabis users' depressive symptoms improved in the CCAP 
      intervention just as much as those who used cannabis less than monthly, whereas 
      monthly users receiving usual care had significantly more depressive symptoms than 
      those using less than monthly. A combined CBT and medication treatment intervention 
      may be a promising approach for the treatment of depression among occasional 
      cannabis users.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Depression is one of the most frequent mental disorders in older 
      people, known to increase rates of disability and mortality. Depression in late 
      life, commonly accompanied by multiple medical illnesses, reduces quality of life 
      and is a strong risk factor for suicide. Despite its clinical significance, 
      depression remains underdiagnosed and inadequately treated in older patients. 
      Cognitive-behavioural psychotherapies have the most empirical support in treating 
      late-life depression, and are recommended by numerous guidelines in this indication. 
      Group interventions are also recommended for older adults because they offer peer 
      support, mitigate social isolation, encourage shared empathy and provide a context 
      for peer feedback help from the group. Previous studies have shown that maladaptive 
      schemas have an important role in the development or maintenance of depression and 
      anxiety in older people, either as risk factors or as vulnerability markers, but 
      there are no studies that have examined the effectiveness of schema-focused therapy 
      to improve depression in late life. OBJECTIVES: The main goals of the present study 
      were to explore the relationship of maladaptive schemas with depression and anxiety 
      severity in aged inpatients, and to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioural 
      individual and group treatment program that includes schema-focused therapy on 
      depression, anxiety, and cognitive schemas activation. METHODS: The sample consisted 
      of aged depressed inpatients (n=51) treated in a psychiatric unit. Participants 
      completed measures of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS]) and anxiety 
      (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]) severity and maladaptive schemas (Cognitive 
      Inventory of Subjective Distress [CISD]) at pre- and post-intervention (mean 
      hospital stay: 4weeks). RESULTS: The maladaptive schemas Loss of Individuality, 
      Refusal of Assistance and Vulnerability are more activated in our sample of 
      depressed subjects with regard to the reference population. Most of specific 
      maladaptive schemas (except Fear of Losing Control) were significantly correlated to 
      depression and anxiety-state severity. The GDS and the STAI scores, and the 
      activation of five of seven maladaptive schemas measured by the CISD decreased 
      significantly after treatment. DISCUSSION: This study confirms the results of 
      previous research and shows that specific maladaptive schemas are related to 
      depression and anxiety severity in clinically depressed aged patients. Contrary to 
      other previous studies, we find that the activation of maladaptive schemas can 
      decrease during a group psychotherapeutic program that includes schema-focused 
      therapy. These findings support the feasibility of individual and group 
      schema-focused therapy to assist older people suffering from depression effectively.

AB  - Contraceptive compliance is defined as the correct use (according to the method 
      specific prescriptions given by a medical professional and/or in written form as 
      patient information leaflet) of a contraceptive method. Non-compliance describes a 
      mismatch between the real behaviour of a user and the correct or ideal behaviour. 
      There are various indicators that in general contraceptive compliance is far from 
      ideal. Many studies report a rate of unintended pregnancies of 50%, half of them 
      terminating in abortion. The abortion rate remains high even in countries with 
      availability of advanced contraceptive technology. Especially with hormonal 
      contraception and barrier methods the gap between correct and real use is large. 
      Discontinuation rates per year reach up to 50%. Reasons for Non Compliance are (a) 
      Lack of motivation to prevent a pregnancy due to ambivalence regarding the wish for 
      a child as well as sexual and relationship issues (b) Cognitive factors (False 
      information, misconceptions, irrational fears) (c) Difficult or lacking access to 
      contraceptive methods (d) Behavioral errors and mistakes (Forgetting, loosing etc.) 
      and (e) Side effects of the methods used. Three strategies to improve compliance can 
      be distinguished: (a) Improving counselling; (b) Developing contraceptive methods 
      which demand a low level of compliant behaviour by the user; (c) Improving quality 
      of life of users by minimizing the negative side effects and maximizing the non 
      contraceptive health benefits.

TI  - Cognitive behavior therapy versus supportive therapy in social phobia: a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 137-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in social phobia has 
      been demonstrated in several controlled trials and meta-analyses, but no comparison 
      of CBT with supportive therapy (ST) can be found in the literature. METHOD: The aim 
      of the trial was to study the effectiveness of CBT versus ST carried out 'as usual'. 
      Sixty-seven DSM-4 social phobic patients (89% generalized subtype, most with 
      avoidant personality) were randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1 (CBT) 
      received 8 1-hour sessions of individual cognitive therapy (CT) for 6 weeks, 
      followed by 6 2-hour sessions of social skills training (SST) in group weekly. Group 
      2 received ST for 12 weeks (6 half-hour sessions), then the patients were switched 
      to CBT. All patients agreed not to take any medication during the whole trial. In 
      group 1, 29 patients reached week 6, 27 reached week 12, and 24 weeks 36 and 60 
      (endpoint). In group 2, 29 patients reached week 6, 28 reached weeks 12 and 18, 26 
      week 24, and 23 reached weeks 48 and 72 (endpoint). RESULTS: At week 6, after CT, 
      group 1 was better than group 2 on the main social phobia measure. At week 12, after 
      SST, group 1 was better than group 2 on most of the measures and demonstrated a 
      significantly higher rate of responders. This finding was replicated after switching 
      group 2 to CBT. Sustained improvement was observed in both groups at follow-up. 
      Compliance with abstinence from medication increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: CBT was 
      more effective than ST and demonstrated long-lasting effects. This may suggest that 
      social phobia management requires more than a simple and inexpensive psychological 
      intervention.

TI  - Does the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy improve panic disorder treatment 
      outcome relative to medication alone in the primary-care setting?
PG  - 1645-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials indicate a benefit from combining medications 
      with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) relative to medication alone for panic 
      disorder. Using an as-treated analysis, we evaluated whether the addition of CBT 
      enhanced outcomes for panic disorder relative to medications alone in the 
      primary-care setting. METHOD: Primary-care patients with panic disorder reported on 
      their receipt of CBT and medications over the 3 months following baseline 
      assessment. The degree to which outcomes for those who used anti-panic medications 
      were enhanced by the receipt of at least one component of CBT was analyzed using a 
      propensity score model that took into account observable baseline patient 
      characteristics influencing both treatment selection and outcomes. RESULTS: The 
      addition of CBT resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvements at 
      3 months on anxiety sensitivity, social avoidance, and disability. Also, patients 
      receiving CBT in the first 3 months of the study were more improved at 12 months 
      than patients who took medications only during the first 3 months of the study. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The clinical utility of the findings are discussed in terms of the 
      importance of primary-care physicians encouraging their panic disorder patients to 
      receive CBT as well as medications.

TI  - Depression, mastery and number of group sessions attended predict outcome of 
      patients with panic and agoraphobia in a behavioural/medication program.
PG  - 283-8
AB  - From a list of 214 patients suffering from panic and agoraphobia and who had been 
      treated with cognitive behaviour therapy, 30 patients who had very good outcomes and 
      32 who had poor outcomes were selected. The groups were selected by the nurse 
      therapist and psychiatrist on the basis of personal knowledge of the patients. The 
      distinction into good and poor outcome groups was confirmed by the results of a 
      follow-up questionnaire completed by the patient. Of several clinical and 
      demographic variables which had been hypothesized to be predictors of outcome, only 
      depression, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, mastery, as measured by 
      the Pearlin Mastery Scale and the number of group therapy sessions attended 
      predicted outcome. Levels of depression and mastery might be clinically modifiable 
      variables which affect the outcome of treatment for patients with panic and 
      agoraphobia.

TI  - Medical illness and response to treatment in primary care panic disorder.
PG  - 237-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although studies have suggested that comorbid medical illness can affect 
      the outcome of patients with depression, little is known about whether medical 
      illness comorbidity affects treatment outcome in patients with anxiety. METHOD: 
      Primary care patients with panic disorder (n=232), participating in a randomized 
      collaborative care intervention of CBT and pharmacology, were divided into those 
      above (n=125) and below (n=107) the median for burden of chronic medical illness and 
      assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. RESULTS: Subjects with a greater burden of 
      medical illness were more psychiatrically ill at baseline, with greater anxiety 
      symptom severity, greater disability and more psychiatric comorbidity. The 
      intervention produced significant and similar increases in amount of evidence-based 
      care, and reductions in clinical symptoms and disability that were comparable in the 
      more and less medically ill groups. CONCLUSIONS: The comparable response of 
      individuals with more severe medical illness suggests that CBT and pharmacotherapy 
      for panic disorder work equally well regardless of medical illness comorbidity. 
      However, the more severe psychiatric illness both at baseline and follow-up in these 
      same individuals suggest that treatment programs may need to be extended in time to 
      optimize treatment outcome.

AB  - Several studies reported a negative effect of early onset and long duration of 
      illness on long-term outcome in psychiatric disorders, including 
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). OCD is a prevalent, comorbid and disabling 
      condition, associated with reduced quality of life and overall well-being for 
      affected patients and related caregivers. The present multicenter naturalistic study 
      sought to assess the influence of early onset and duration of illness on long-term 
      outcome in a sample of 376 OCD out-patients worldwide, as part of the "International 
      College of Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders" (ICOCS) network. Binary logistic 
      regressions were performed with age at the onset and duration of illness, as 
      continuous independent variables, on a series of different outcome dependent 
      variables, including lifetime number of hospitalizations and suicide attempts, 
      poly-therapy and psychiatric comorbidity. Correlations in terms of disability (SDS) 
      were analyzed as well. Results showed that a longer duration of illness (but not 
      earlier age of onset) was associated with hospitalization (odds ratio=1.03, p=0.01), 
      earlier age at onset with CBT (odds ratio=0.94, p<0.001) and both a later age at 
      onset (odds ratio=1.05, p=0.02) and a shorter duration of illness (odds ratio=0.93, 
      p=0.02) with panic disorder comorbidity. In addition, earlier age at onset inversely 
      correlated with higher social disability (r=-0.12, p=0.048) and longer duration of 
      illness directly correlated with higher disability in work, social and family life 
      (r=0.14, p=0.017; r=0.13, p=0.035; r=0.14, p=0.02). The findings from the present 
      large, multicenter study indicate early onset and long duration of illness as 
      overall negative predictors of long-term outcome in OCD.

TI  - Strategy for treating selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant social 
      anxiety disorder in the clinical setting: a randomised controlled trial protocol of 
      cognitive behavioural therapy in combination with conventional treatment.
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2012-002242 [doi]
LID - e002242
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are 
      consistently effective as first-line treatments for social anxiety disorders (SADs). 
      Nevertheless, pharmacotherapy is often the first choice in clinical practice. In 
      many countries, the first line of pharmacotherapy involves the administration of a 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Although a significant proportion of 
      patients with SAD fail to respond to the initial SSRI administration, there is no 
      standard approach to the management of SSRI-resistant SAD. This paper describes the 
      study protocol for a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical 
      effectiveness of CBT as a next-step strategy, concomitant with conventional 
      treatment, for patients with SSRI-resistant SAD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 
      Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point study is designed with two parallel 
      groups, with dynamic allocation at the individual level. The interventions for the 
      two groups are conventional treatment, alone, and CBT combined with conventional 
      treatment, for 16 weeks. The primary end-point of SAD severity will be assessed by 
      an independent assessor using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, and secondary 
      end-points include severity of other social anxieties, depressive severity and 
      functional impairment. All measures will be assessed at weeks 0 (baseline), 8 
      (halfway point) and 16 (postintervention) and the outcomes will be analysed based on 
      the intent-to-treat. Statistical analyses are planned for the study design stage so 
      that field materials can be appropriately designed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This 
      study will be conducted at the academic outpatient clinic of Chiba University 
      Hospital. Ethics approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of Chiba 
      University Hospital. All participants will be required to provide written informed 
      consent. The trial will be implemented and reported in accordance with the 
      recommendations of CONSORT. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000007552.

TI  - Neural correlates of procedural variants in cognitive-behavioral therapy: a 
      randomized, controlled multicenter FMRI study.
PG  - 222-33
LID - 10.1159/000359955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). It is unknown, how variants of CBT differentially 
      modulate brain networks involved in PD/AG. This study was aimed to evaluate the 
      effects of therapist-guided (T+) versus self-guided (T-) exposure on the neural 
      correlates of fear conditioning in PD/AG. METHOD: In a randomized, controlled 
      multicenter clinical trial in medication-free patients with PD/AG who were treated 
      with 12 sessions of manualized CBT, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was 
      used during fear conditioning before (t1) and after CBT (t2). Quality-controlled 
      fMRI data from 42 patients and 42 healthy subjects (HS) were obtained. Patients were 
      randomized to two variants of CBT (T+, n = 22, and T-, n = 20). RESULTS: The 
      interaction of diagnosis (PD/AG, HS), treatment group (T+, T-), time point (t1, t2) 
      and stimulus type (conditioned stimulus: yes, no) revealed activation in the left 
      hippocampus and the occipitotemporal cortex. The T+ group demonstrated increased 
      activation of the hippocampus at t2 (t2 > t1), which was positively correlated with 
      treatment outcome, and a decreased connectivity between the left inferior frontal 
      gyrus and the left hippocampus across time (t1 > t2). CONCLUSION: After T+ exposure, 
      contingency-encoding processes related to the posterior hippocampus are augmented 
      and more decoupled from processes of the left inferior frontal gyrus, previously 
      shown to be dysfunctionally activated in PD/AG. Linking single procedural variants 
      to neural substrates offers the potential to inform about the optimization of 
      targeted psychotherapeutic interventions.

TI  - An initial trial of a computerized behavioral intervention for cannabis use 
      disorder.
PG  - 74-9
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.10.014 [doi]
AB  - The most potent outcomes for cannabis use disorders have been observed with a 
      combination of three evidence-based interventions, motivational enhancement therapy 
      (MET), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and abstinence-based 
      contingency-management (CM). Access to this intervention remains limited because of 
      cost and service availability issues. This report describes the initial stages of a 
      project designed to develop and test a computer-assisted version of MET/CBT/CM that 
      could address many of the current barriers to its dissemination. A nonrandomized, 
      12-week comparison study assigned 38 adults seeking treatment for a cannabis use 
      disorder to either therapist-delivered (n=22) or computer-delivered (n=16) 
      MET/CBT/CM. Attendance, retention, and cannabis use outcomes did not differ 
      significantly between groups, and there were no indications of superior outcomes 
      favoring therapist delivery. Participants provided positive ratings of the 
      computer-delivered sessions. These preliminary findings suggest that 
      computer-assisted delivery of MET/CBT/CM is acceptable to outpatients and does not 
      adversely impact compliance or outcomes achieved during treatment with MET/CBT/CM 
      for cannabis use disorders. Assessment of post-treatment outcomes and replication in 
      randomized trials are needed to determine reliability and longer term effects. As 
      observed in a growing number of studies, computerized therapies have the potential 
      to increase access to, reduce costs, and enhance fidelity of providing 
      evidence-based treatments without sacrificing and possibly enhancing effectiveness.

TI  - A pilot study of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for treatment-resistant anxiety 
      disorders.
PG  - 112-21
LID - 10.1016/j.brs.2008.02.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an effective anticonvulsant device and 
      has shown antidepressant effects in chronic treatment resistant depression. Because 
      the vagus nerve sends information to brain regions important in anxiety regulation 
      (locus coeruleus, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, hippocampus and amygdala), this 
      pathway might be involved in perceiving or manifesting various somatic and cognitive 
      symptoms that characterize anxiety disorders. On the basis of this reasoning and 
      reports of anxiolytic effects of VNS in patients treated for epilepsy and 
      depression, we organized an open-label pilot acute trial of adjunctive VNS on top of 
      stable medications, followed by long-term follow-up, to assess the safety and 
      potential efficacy of VNS for patients with treatment resistant anxiety disorders. 
      METHODS: Eleven adult outpatients with treatment resistant obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 
      recruited. Patients had failed several medication trials as well as cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT). All patients were rated with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale 
      (HAM-A) and the clinical global impressions improvement scale (CGI-I). Patients with 
      OCD were also rated with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). 
      Patients were maintained on their current psychotropic medications at fixed doses 
      during the acute 12-week phase. Changes in medications and VNS stimulus parameters 
      were allowed during the long-term follow-up. Response was defined as a 50% or 
      greater improvement on the HAM-A for all patients and a 25% or greater improvement 
      on the Y-BOCS for patients with OCD. RESULTS: Eleven patients were recruited. Seven 
      patients had a primary diagnosis of OCD, two had PTSD, and one had PD. One OCD 
      patient changed their mind and was never implanted. One patient with OCD withdrew 
      consent before the end of the acute phase, so long-term results were available for 
      nine patients. Three patients were acute responders, based on the HAM-A, and there 
      was some improvement in anxiety ratings over time (with statistically significant 
      improvements at 14 of 18 quarters during long-term follow-up). Of the seven patients 
      with OCD who received stimulation, three were acute responders, based on the Y-BOCS, 
      and there was some improvement in Y-BOCS scores over time (with statistically 
      significant improvements at 7 of 18 quarters during long-term follow-up). VNS was 
      relatively well tolerated. Four years after implantation, four patients (diagnoses 
      two OCD, one PD, one PTSD) were still receiving VNS with continued and sustained 
      improvement in anxiety scores compared with their baseline scores. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These patients with treatment-resistant anxiety disorders generally tolerated VNS 
      treatment, and there was evidence of acute and long-term improvement in some 
      patients. These open data suggest that further double-blind studies assessing the 
      VNS role in treating anxiety disorders, particularly OCD, may be warranted.

TI  - Remission after acute treatment in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders: 
      findings from the CAMS.
PG  - 806-13
LID - 10.1037/a0025933 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report on remission rates in anxious youth who participated in the 
      Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). The CAMS, a multisite clinical 
      trial, randomized 488 children and adolescents (ages 7-17 years; 79% Caucasian; 50% 
      female) with separation, social, and/or generalized anxiety disorder to a 12-week 
      treatment of sertraline (SRT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), their combination 
      (COMB), or clinical management with pill placebo (PBO). METHOD: The primary 
      definition of remission was loss of all study-entry anxiety disorder diagnoses; 
      additional definitions of remission were used. All outcomes were rated by 
      independent evaluators blind to treatment assignment. Predictors of remission were 
      also examined. RESULTS: Remission rates after 12 weeks of treatment ranged from 46% 
      to 68% for COMB, 34% to 46% for SRT, 20% to 46% for CBT, and 15% to 27% for PBO. 
      Rates of remission (i.e., achieving a nearly symptom-free state) were significantly 
      lower than rates of response (i.e., achieving a clinically meaningful improvement 
      relative to baseline) for the entire sample. Youth who received COMB had 
      significantly higher rates of remission compared to all other treatment groups. Both 
      monotherapies had higher remission rates compared to PBO, but rates were not 
      different from each other. Predictors of remission were younger age, nonminority 
      status, lower baseline anxiety severity, absence of other internalizing disorders 
      (e.g., anxiety, depression), and absence of social phobia. CONCLUSIONS: For the 
      majority of children, some symptoms of anxiety persisted, even among those showing 
      improvement after 12 weeks of treatment, suggesting a need to augment or extend 
      current treatments for some children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine optimal Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) percent 
      reduction and raw score cut-offs for predicting treatment response and remission 
      among children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. METHOD: Data were from a 
      subset of youth (N = 438; 7-17 years of age) who participated in the 
      Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), a multi-site, randomized 
      controlled trial that examined the relative efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT; Coping Cat), medication (sertraline [SRT]), their combination, and pill 
      placebo for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety 
      disorder, and social phobia. The clinician-rated PARS was administered pre- and 
      posttreatment (delivered over 12 weeks). Quality receiver operating characteristic 
      methods assessed the performance of various PARS percent reductions and absolute 
      cut-off scores in predicting treatment response and remission, as determined by 
      posttreatment ratings on the Clinical Global Impression scales and the Anxiety 
      Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV. Corresponding change in impairment was 
      evaluated using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale. RESULTS: Reductions of 35% and 50% 
      on the six-item PARS optimally predicted treatment response and remission, 
      respectively. Post-treatment PARS raw scores of 8 to 10 optimally predicted 
      remission. Anxiety improved as a function of PARS-defined treatment response and 
      remission. CONCLUSIONS: Results serve as guidelines for operationalizing treatment 
      response and remission in future research and in making cross-study comparisons. 
      These guidelines can facilitate translation of research findings into clinical 
      practice.

AB  - The acute efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the 
      treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) is well established; however their role 
      in longer-term prevention of recurrence remains unconfirmed. This study aims at 
      examining: the prophylactic efficacy of four commonly used SSRIs in MDD in a 
      naturalistic setting with long-term follow-up, the effect of concomitant cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT), and the predictors of outcome. In a prospective cohort 
      study, 387 patients who either remitted or responded following treatment with four 
      different SSRIs-fluoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline and paroxetine-were followed up 
      over several years. During an average follow-up period of 34.5 months, 76.5% of 
      patients experienced MDD recurrence. Escitalopram and fluoxetine showed a 
      numerically higher prophylactic efficacy than paroxetine and sertraline but the 
      difference was statistically insignificant. The prophylactic efficacy for SSRI-only 
      treatment was limited, with a recurrence rate of 82.0%, compared to 59.0% of patient 
      recurrence rate in concomitant Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The relatively 
      small size of the CBT group and the lack of randomization may undermine the 
      extrapolation of its findings to clinical practice. Nevertheless, the study 
      preliminary data may help in defining the clinical utility of antidepressants and 
      CBT in the prophylaxis from MDD recurrence.

TI  - Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in patients with panic 
      disorder: as a biological predictor of response to group cognitive behavioral 
      therapy.
PG  - 658-63
AB  - Little is known about biological predictors of treatment response in panic disorder. 
      Our previous studies show that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play 
      a role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorders and eating disorders. 
      Assuming that BDNF may be implicated in the putative common etiologies of depression 
      and anxiety, the authors examined serum BDNF levels of the patients with panic 
      disorder, and its correlation with therapeutic response to group cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT). Group CBT (10 consecutive 1 h weekly sessions) was 
      administered to the patients with panic disorder after consulting the panic 
      outpatient special service. Before treatment, serum concentrations of BDNF and total 
      cholesterol were measured. After treatment, we defined response to therapy as a 40% 
      reduction from baseline on Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score as described 
      by [Barlow, D.H., Gorman, J.M., Shear, M.K., Woods, S.W., 2000. Cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy, imipramine, or their combination for panic disorder: A randomized 
      controlled trial. JAMA. 283, 2529-2536]. There were 26 good responders and 16 poor 
      responders. 31 age- and sex-matched healthy normal control subjects were also 
      recruited in this study. The serum BDNF levels of the patients with poor response 
      (25.9 ng/ml [S.D. 8.7]) were significantly lower than those of the patients with 
      good response (33.7 ng/ml [S.D. 7.5]). However, there were no significant 
      differences in both groups of the patients, compared to the normal controls (29.1 
      ng/ml [S.D. 7.1]). No significant differences of other variables including total 
      cholesterol levels before treatment were detected between good responders and poor 
      responders. These results suggested that BDNF might contribute to therapeutic 
      response of panic disorder. A potential link between an increased risk of secondary 
      depression and BDNF remains to be investigated in the future.

AB  - PURPOSE: Stress and anxiety are potential consequences from arrhythmias and 
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shocks that can contribute to 
      substantial morbidity. We assessed anxiety associated with an ICD and whether 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) reduces anxiety. METHODS: The study consisted of 
      two parts: part 1 (N = 690) was a prospective cross-sectional observational study of 
      consecutive ICD patients. Patients completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Florida Shock Anxiety Scale (FSAS), and 
      Florida Patient Acceptance Survey (FPAS) psychometric tests. Part 2 (N = 29) was a 
      pilot randomized controlled trial of CBT (three sessions in 3 months) vs. usual care 
      (UC) in patients with BAI ≥ 19 from part 1. RESULTS: The median BAI and GAD-7 scores 
      were 5 and 2, respectively. By BAI scores, 64.5 % had minimal and 3.9 % had severe 
      anxiety. By GAD-7 scores, 73.0 % had low probability of anxiety and 2.9 % had high 
      anxiety. Higher anxiety levels were associated with recent (p = 0.017) and total 
      number of shocks (p = 0.002). Any shock was associated with fear about shocks (FSAS, 
      p < 0.001) and reduced patient ICD acceptance (FPAS, p = 0.019). In the pilot trial 
      of CBT, median BAI scores decreased from 24.5 to 11 at 1 year (p = 0.031) in the CBT 
      group and GAD-7 scores from 12.5 to 7 (p = 0.063); no significant changes in anxiety 
      scores were observed in the UC group. CONCLUSIONS: Severe anxiety was present in a 
      small proportion of ICD patients, but higher anxiety was associated with recent and 
      total number of shocks. The small pilot study suggested that a simple program of CBT 
      might lower moderate-high anxiety with lasting effects to 1 year and supports the 
      need for a larger trial to validate these results. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Incremental cost-effectiveness of a collaborative care intervention for panic 
      disorder.
PG  - 353-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder is a prevalent, often disabling, disorder among 
      primary-care patients, but there are large gaps in quality of treatment in primary 
      care. This study describes the incremental cost-effectiveness of a combined 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy intervention for patients 
      with panic disorder versus usual primary-care treatment. METHOD: This randomized 
      control trial recruited 232 primary-care patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for panic 
      disorder from March 2000 to March 2002 from six primary-care clinics from 
      university-affiliated clinics at the University of Washington (Seattle) and 
      University of California (Los Angeles and San Diego). Patients were randomly 
      assigned to receive either treatment as usual or a combined CBT and pharmacotherapy 
      intervention for panic disorder delivered in primary care by a mental health 
      therapist. Intervention patients had up to six sessions of CBT modified for the 
      primary-care setting in the first 12 weeks, and up to six telephone follow-ups over 
      the next 9 months. The primary outcome variables were total out-patient costs, 
      anxiety-free days (AFDs) and quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Relative 
      to usual care, intervention patients experienced 60.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
      42.9-77.9] more AFDs over a 12-month period. Total incremental out-patient costs 
      were 492 US dollars higher (95% CI 236-747 US dollars ) in intervention versus usual 
      care patients with a cost per additional AFD of 8.40 US dollars (95% CI 2.80-14.0 US 
      dollars ) and a cost per QALY ranging from 14,158 US dollars (95% CI 6,791-21,496 US 
      dollars ) to 24,776 US dollars (95% CI 11,885-37,618 US dollars ). The cost per QALY 
      estimate is well within the range of other commonly accepted medical interventions 
      such as statin use and treatment of hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: The combined CBT and 
      pharmacotherapy intervention was associated with a robust clinical improvement 
      compared to usual care with a moderate increase in ambulatory costs.

PG  - 267-78
LID - 10.1080/15402002.2014.981819 [doi]
AB  - Despite the ubiquity of sleep complaints among individuals with anxiety disorders, 
      few prior studies have examined whether sleep quality improves during anxiety 
      treatment. The current study examined pre- to posttreatment sleep quality 
      improvement during cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder (PD; n = 
      26) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 24). Among sleep quality indices, only 
      global sleep quality and sleep latency improved significantly (but modestly) during 
      CBT. Sleep quality improvement was greater for treatment responders, but did not 
      vary by diagnosis. Additionally, poor baseline sleep quality was independently 
      associated with worse anxiety treatment outcome, as measured by higher intolerance 
      of uncertainty. Additional intervention targeting sleep prior to or during CBT for 
      anxiety may be beneficial for poor sleepers.

TI  - Mediators of change in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Treatment Study.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1037/a0039773 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Test changes in (a) coping efficacy and (b) anxious self-talk as 
      potential mediators of treatment gains at 3-month follow-up in the Child/Adolescent 
      Anxiety Multimodal Treatment Study (CAMS). METHOD: Participants were 488 youth (ages 
      7-17; 50.4% male) randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping cat 
      program), pharmacotherapy (sertraline), their combination, or pill placebo. 
      Participants met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth 
      Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or 
      separation anxiety disorder. Coping efficacy (reported ability to manage anxiety 
      provoking situations) was measured by youth and parent reports on the Coping 
      Questionnaire, and anxious self-talk was measured by youth report on the Negative 
      Affectivity Self-Statement Questionnaire. Outcome was measured using the Pediatric 
      Anxiety Rating Scale (completed by Independent Evaluators blind to condition). For 
      temporal precedence, residualized treatment gains were assessed at 3-month 
      follow-up. RESULTS: Residualized gains in coping efficacy mediated gains in the CBT, 
      sertraline, and combination conditions. In the combination condition, some unique 
      effect of treatment remained. Treatment assignment was not associated with a 
      reduction in anxious self-talk, nor did anxious self-talk predict changes in anxiety 
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that improvements in coping efficacy are 
      a mediator of treatment gains. Anxious self-talk did not emerge as a mediator.

TI  - Psychological flexibility as a mediator of improvement in Acceptance and Commitment 
      Therapy for patients with chronic pain following whiplash.
PG  - 1059.e1-1059.e11
LID - 10.1016/j.ejpain.2010.05.001 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has made important contributions to chronic pain 
      management, but the process by which it is effective is not clear. Recently, strong 
      arguments have been raised concerning the need for theory driven research to e.g. 
      identify mechanisms of change in CBT and enhance the effectiveness of this type of 
      treatment. However, the number of studies addressing these issues is still 
      relatively scarce. Furthermore, the arrival of varieties of CBT with seemingly 
      different process targets increases the need for such information. The present study 
      explored the processes of change in a previously reported successful randomized 
      controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of an exposure-based form of 
      behavioral and cognitive therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), on 
      improvement in pain-related disability and life satisfaction for patients suffering 
      from whiplash-associated disorder (WAD). Several process variables relevant to 
      theories underlying traditional CBT were included: pain, distress, kinesiophobia, 
      self-efficacy, and the process primarily targeted by ACT: psychological 
      inflexibility. Mediation analyses were performed using a non-parametric 
      cross-product of the coefficients approach. Results illustrated that pain intensity, 
      anxiety, depression, kinesiophobia, and self-efficacy did not have significant 
      mediating effects on the dependent variables. In contrast, significant indirect 
      effects were seen for psychological inflexibility on pain-related disability (pre- 
      to post-change scores) and life satisfaction (pre- to post; pre- to 4-month 
      follow-up change scores). Although tentative, these results support the mediating 
      role of psychological inflexibility in ACT-oriented interventions aimed at improving 
      functioning and life satisfaction in people with chronic pain.

TI  - Effects of parent and family characteristics on treatment outcome of anxious 
      children.
PG  - 835-48
AB  - This study examines relations between family functioning, parenting stress, parental 
      psychopathology, and treatment outcome. Participants included 61 children (ages 7-11 
      years) with features or diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, generalized 
      anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia. Treatment conditions included group 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and no-treatment control. Higher family cohesion 
      at baseline was associated with significantly greater decreases in child anxiety at 
      posttreatment for participants who received CBT, while no association was found for 
      the no-treatment control participants. Parenting stress and parental psychopathology 
      were not associated with treatment outcome for either condition. Post hoc analyses 
      examining relations between family cohesion, parenting stress, and parental 
      psychopathology showed that parents from families low in cohesion reported 
      significantly higher levels of parenting stress and psychopathology compared to 
      parents from families high in cohesion. These results will facilitate development 
      and implementation of effective interventions with anxious children.

TI  - A pilot study of two-day cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder.
PG  - 807-17
AB  - The present study investigated the short-term efficacy of brief, intensive 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder (PD). The treatment involved 
      9h of therapist contact over two consecutive days and was developed for the purpose 
      of delivering CBT for PD to a largely rural patient population that must travel long 
      distances to find a treatment provider. Ten patients who elected to participate in 
      brief, intensive CBT instead of weekly CBT were recruited from routine clinical 
      practice in a hospital-based anxiety disorders clinic. Patients were not excluded 
      based on the presence of agoraphobia, diagnostic comorbidity, concurrent use of PRN 
      benzodiazepine medications, or previous nonresponse to psychotherapy for PD. 
      Assessments conducted at pre-treatment and 1-month follow-up revealed large, 
      clinically significant reductions in PD symptoms, anxiety sensitivity, body 
      vigilance, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Most patients (60%) were panic-free 
      after treatment and evidenced normative levels of symptomatology at follow-up. The 
      present study suggests that brief, intensive treatment may be an effective means of 
      delivering CBT for PD.

TI  - Support Vector Machine Analysis of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of 
      Interoception Does Not Reliably Predict Individual Outcomes of Cognitive Behavioral 
      Therapy in Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia.
PG  - 99
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00099 [doi]
LID - 99
AB  - BACKGROUND: The approach to apply multivariate pattern analyses based on neuro 
      imaging data for outcome prediction holds out the prospect to improve therapeutic 
      decisions in mental disorders. Patients suffering from panic disorder with 
      agoraphobia (PD/AG) often exhibit an increased perception of bodily sensations. The 
      purpose of this investigation was to assess whether multivariate classification 
      applied to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) interoception paradigm can 
      predict individual responses to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in PD/AG. 
      METHODS: This analysis is based on pretreatment fMRI data during an interoceptive 
      challenge from a multicenter trial of the German PANIC-NET. Patients with DSM-IV 
      PD/AG were dichotomized as responders (n = 30) or non-responders (n = 29) based on 
      the primary outcome (Hamilton Anxiety Scale Reduction ≥50%) after 6 weeks of CBT 
      (2 h/week). fMRI parametric maps were used as features for response classification 
      with linear support vector machines (SVM) with or without automated feature 
      selection. Predictive accuracies were assessed using cross validation and 
      permutation testing. The influence of methodological parameters and the predictive 
      ability for specific interoception-related symptom reduction were further evaluated. 
      RESULTS: SVM did not reach sufficient overall predictive accuracies (38.0-54.2%) for 
      anxiety reduction in the primary outcome. In the exploratory analyses, better 
      accuracies (66.7%) were achieved for predicting interoception-specific symptom 
      relief as an alternative outcome domain. Subtle information regarding this 
      alternative response criterion but not the primary outcome was revealed by post hoc 
      univariate comparisons. CONCLUSION: In contrast to reports on other neurofunctional 
      probes, SVM based on an interoception paradigm was not able to reliably predict 
      individual response to CBT. Results speak against the clinical applicability of this 
      technique.

TI  - Avoidance Moderates Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia.
LID - 10.1097/NMD.0000000000001195 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a well-validated treatment for panic disorder, 
      includes interoceptive exposures and possibly in vivo exposures to agoraphobic 
      situations. Testing predictors and moderators of CBT outcomes can improve treatment 
      efficacy. Sixty-six individuals with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were 
      randomized to panic control therapy (PCT) (n = 32) or PCT and in vivo exposures to 
      agoraphobic situations (PCT + IV) (n = 34). Secondary analyses using multilevel 
      models with repeated measures design revealed that individuals who displayed more 
      interoceptive avoidance and agoraphobic avoidance fared better after PCT than PCT + 
      IV compared with individuals who displayed less avoidance. Results suggest that 
      these individuals benefit from concentrated doses of exposures to their primary 
      interoceptive concerns instead of additional exposures to agoraphobic situations. 
      Exploratory analyses were also conducted on fear, demographic factors, and clinical 
      characteristics. Findings inform clinical decision-making and personalized medicine. 
      Limitations include low power for detecting small effect sizes.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioural interventions for children who have been sexually abused.
PG  - CD001930
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite differences in perceptions of what constitutes child sexual 
      abuse there is a general consensus amongst clinicians and researchers that this is a 
      substantial social problem which affects large numbers of children and young people 
      worldwide. The effects of sexual abuse manifest themselves in a wide range of 
      symptoms, including fear, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and behaviour 
      problems such as externalising or internalising, or inappropriate sexual behaviours. 
      Child sexual abuse is associated with increased risk of psychological problems in 
      adulthood. Knowing what is most likely to benefit children already traumatised by 
      these events is important. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to assess the 
      efficacy of cognitive-behavioural approaches (CBT) in addressing the immediate and 
      longer-term sequelae on children who have been sexually abused. SEARCH STRATEGY: The 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2005), MEDLINE 
      (1966-November 2005); EMBASE (1980-November 2005); CINAHL (1982-November 2005), 
      PsycINFO (1897-November 2005); LILACS (1982-November 2005); SIGLE (1980 to November 
      2005) and the register of the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning 
      Problems Group (November 2005) were searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Included studies 
      were randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of 
      cognitive behavioural therapy on children and adolescents up to age 18 years who had 
      experienced sexual abuse. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Titles and abstracts 
      identified in the search were independently assessed for eligibility by two 
      reviewers (GM and PR). Data were extracted and entered into REVMAN (JH and GM), and 
      synthesised and presented in both written and graphical form (forest plots). MAIN 
      RESULTS: Ten trials, including 847 participants, were included in this review. Data 
      suggest that CBT may have a positive impact on the sequelae of child sexual abuse, 
      but most results were statistically non-significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The 
      review confirms CBT's potential as a means of addressing the adverse consequences of 
      child sexual abuse, but highlights the tenuousness of the evidence base and the need 
      for more carefully conducted and better reported trials.

TI  - A trial of a relapse prevention strategy in women with bulimia nervosa who respond 
      to cognitive-behavior therapy.
PG  - 549-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines a relapse prevention strategy for bulimia nervosa 
      (BN). Subjects in a multicenter BN treatment trial who initially achieved abstinence 
      after a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) were told to recontact the 
      clinic if they had a recurrence of symptoms or feared such a reoccurrence so that 
      they could receive additional therapy visits. METHOD: At the end of CBT, subjects 
      whose scores on the Eating Disorders Examination indicated that they were abstinent 
      from binge eating and purging, and therefore considered to be treated successfully, 
      were assigned randomly to follow-up only or to a crisis intervention model. With the 
      crisis intervention model, subjects would receive additional visits if needed. 
      RESULTS: None of the 30 subjects who relapsed during the follow-up sought additional 
      treatment visits. DISCUSSION: Simply telling patients with BN who appear to have 
      been successfully treated to come back if they have additional problems, or fear 
      that they are developing such problems, may be an ineffective relapse prevention 
      technique. Alternative strategies, such as planned return visits or phone calls, 
      should be considered as alternative relapse prevention strategies.

AB  - Recent clinical trial research suggests that baseline low end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2), 
      the biological marker of hyperventilation) may predict poorer response to 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety-related disorders. The present study 
      examined the predictive value of baseline ETCO(2) among patients treated for such 
      disorders in a naturalistic clinical setting. Sixty-nine adults with a primary 
      diagnosis of a DSM-5 anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or 
      posttraumatic stress disorder completed a 4-min assessment of resting ETCO(2), and 
      respiration rate (the first minute was analyzed). Lower ETCO(2) was not associated 
      with a diagnosis of panic disorder, and was associated with lower subjective 
      distress ratings on certain measures. Baseline ETCO(2) significantly predicted 
      treatment dropout: those meeting cutoff criteria for hypocapnia were more than twice 
      as likely to drop out of treatment, and ETCO(2) significantly predicted dropout 
      beyond other pre-treatment variables. Weekly measurement suggested that the 
      lower-ETCO(2) patients who dropped out were not responding well to treatment prior 
      to dropout. The present results, along with previous clinical trial data, suggest 
      that lower pre-treatment ETCO(2) is a negative prognostic indicator for CBT for 
      anxiety-related disorders. It is suggested that patients with lower ETCO(2) might 
      benefit from additional intervention that targets respiratory abnormality.

TI  - [Treatment of anxiety syndrome. A systematic literature review. Summary and 
      conclusions by the SBU].
PG  - 3561-2, 3565-6, 3569
AB  - A report by the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) has 
      reviewed, classified and evaluated the scientific literature on treatment of panic 
      syndrome, specific phobias, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive syndrome (OCD), 
      generalized anxiety syndrome (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 
      review included treatment of children, adolescents and adults. The report concludes 
      that there is effective treatment available for all anxiety syndromes. However in 
      general, the effect is often moderate and symptoms reappear when the treatment 
      period is discontinued. For adults, scientific evidence supports the use of 
      paroxetine and sertraline for all syndromes except specific phobias. For the other 
      SSRI's there is also evidence for the use of fluoxetin in OCD and PTSD, for 
      fluvoxamine in social phobia and OCD and for escitalopram in social phobia. Other 
      antidepressant drugs with a strong scientific support is venlafaxin in social phobia 
      and GAD, imipramin in panic syndrome and chlomipramine in panic syndrome and OCD. 
      Among psychological treatments, there is scientific evidence for cognitive behavior 
      therapy (CBT) for treatment of panic syndrome, specific phobias, social phobia, PTSD 
      and GAD. Exposure, with or without other psychotherapeutic interventions, has 
      scientific support for efficacy in panic disorder (both in terms of number of panic 
      attacks and for agoraphobia), specific phobias, OCD and PTSD. Use of eye movement 
      desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has scientific support for treatment of 
      PTSD.

TI  - The development of the virtual reality system for the treatment of the fears of 
      public speaking.
PG  - 209-11
AB  - The fear of public speaking is a kind of social phobias. The patients having the 
      fear of public speaking show some symptoms like shame and timidity in the daily 
      personal relationship. They are afraid that the other person would be puzzled, feel 
      insulted, and they also fear that they should be underestimated for their mistakes. 
      For the treatment of the fear of public speaking, the cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      has been generally used. The cognitive-behavioral therapy is the method that makes 
      the patients gradually experience some situations inducing the fears and overcome 
      those at last. Recently, the virtual reality technology has been introduced as an 
      alternative method for providing phobic situations. In this study, we developed the 
      public speaking simulator and the virtual environments for the treatment of the fear 
      of public speaking. The head-mounted display, the head-tracker and the 3 dimensional 
      sound system were used for the immersive virtual environment. The imagery of the 
      virtual environment consists of a seminar room and 8 virtual audiences. The patient 
      will speak in front of these virtual audiences and the therapist can control 
      motions, facial expressions, sounds, and voices of each virtual audience.

TI  - Sensitization of catastrophic cognition in cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic 
      disorder.
PG  - 70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive model of panic disorder have proposed that panic attacks 
      result from the catastrophic misinterpretation of certain bodily sensations. 
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for panic disorder aims to change these 
      catastrophic cognitions. CBT intervention successfully caused reduction of 
      catastrophic cognitions and symptomatic improvement in the majority of cases. 
      However there are some patients who fail to modify their catastrophic cognitions or 
      rather experience an increase in them during CBT treatment. It is clinically and 
      theoretically important to understand about cognitive sensitization of panic 
      disorder during CBT sessions. The purpose of the present study is 1) to clarify the 
      baseline characteristics of panic patients who would experience sensitization of 
      their catastrophic cognitions through the CBT treatment, and 2) to examine the 
      course of symptomatic changes for them. METHODS: Of ninety-five outpatients with 
      panic disorder started the group CBT program for treatment of panic disorder, 
      seventy-nine completer were classified as "cognitively sensitized (CS)" or 
      "cognitive responding (CR)" or "no-responder" according to the difference of the 
      Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire score across treatment. We compared the CS and 
      CR patients in terms of their baseline clinical characteristics. Then we assessed 
      the symptomatic and functional changes for both groups. RESULTS: At the start of the 
      CBT program, despite of the same degree of panic disorder severity, CS scored 
      significantly lower on ACQ score than CR. CS also showed significantly lower score 
      on anticipatory anxiety compared to CR. At the end of treatment CS showed 
      significant improvement in severity of panic disorder, although the degree of 
      improvement was smaller than that for CR. Then CS would progressively reduce their 
      agoraphobic fear and avoidance, and would improve their functional impairment up to 
      three month of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Panic patients who would experience 
      sensitization of their catastrophic cognitions through the CBT treatment could 
      nonetheless gradually improve. They showed a relatively low level of catastrophic 
      cognition and anticipatory anxiety before starting the CBT program. We might 
      conclude that temporary sensitization of catastrophic cognition may be necessary 
      before improvement especially among those with initially low catastrophic body 
      sensation fears and that we need not be concerned too much with temporary increase 
      in catastrophic cognition in the process of CBT for panic disorder.

TI  - Manualized Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder: A Case Study.
PG  - 35-47
AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is one of the most 
      common anxiety disorders and has been shown to be effectively treated using 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Recently, a manualized CBT treatment for SAD has 
      been developed (Hope, Heimberg, & Turk, 2006), with research demonstrating superior 
      treatment outcomes with CBT relative to alternatives (e.g., psychotropic 
      medication). The current case study of Henry, a 26-year old Caucasian male with SAD, 
      implemented this manualized CBT for SAD. Treatment consisted of 15 individual 
      sessions, with follow-ups occurring 2 and 8 months post-treatment. Henry showed 
      marked reductions in SAD symptoms throughout the course of treatment, resulting in 
      complete remission of SAD at the end of formal treatment. His SAD continued to be in 
      remission at the 2-and 8-month follow-up sessions. This case study demonstrates the 
      usefulness of a manualized, individual CBT treatment for SAD.

TI  - CBT Specific Process in Exposure-Based Treatments: Initial Examination in a 
      Pediatric OCD Sample.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - Cognitive-Behavioral theory and empirical support suggest that optimal activation of 
      fear is a critical component for successful exposure treatment. Using this theory, 
      we developed coding methodology for measuring CBT-specific process during exposure. 
      We piloted this methodology in a sample of young children (N = 18) who previously 
      received CBT as part of a randomized controlled trial. Results supported the 
      preliminary reliability and predictive validity of coding variables with 12 week and 
      3 month treatment outcome data, generally showing results consistent with CBT 
      theory. However, given our limited and restricted sample, additional testing is 
      warranted. Measurement of CBT-specific process using this methodology may have 
      implications for understanding mechanism of change in exposure-based treatments and 
      for improving dissemination efforts through identification of therapist behaviors 
      associated with improved outcome.

TI  - Relapse following combined treatment discontinuation in a placebo-controlled trial 
      for panic disorder.
PG  - 548-55
LID - 10.1097/NMD.0b013e31817cf6f7 [doi]
AB  - A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Barlow et al., 2000 JAMA. 
      283:2529-2536) examined separate and synergistic effects of psychological and 
      pharmacological treatments for panic disorder. One finding warranting further 
      investigation involved relatively high relapse rates of participants who received 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) + imipramine when compared with those receiving 
      CBT + placebo. In this article, we investigate why CBT was less effective in 
      protecting against relapse for individuals in the active drug condition. We 
      hypothesized that participants correctly deduced treatment assignments and, for 
      those taking imipramine, this was associated with the belief that they were no 
      longer taking active drug after discontinuation, accounting for increased relapse 
      rates. Contrary to hypothesis, there were no group differences in frequencies of 
      guessing drug or placebo, nor were specific beliefs about taking drug or placebo 
      differentially associated with relapse. Other possible reasons for differential 
      relapse rates and treatment implications are discussed.

TI  - Beyond generalized anxiety disorder: psychometric properties of the GAD-7 in a 
      heterogeneous psychiatric sample.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although developed as a screener for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) 
      in primary care, the GAD-7 is now commonly used as a measure of general anxiety 
      symptoms across various settings and populations. However, little is known about its 
      psychometric properties when used in such heterogeneous samples. We examined the 
      internal consistency, convergent validity, sensitivity and specificity, sensitivity 
      to change, and structure of the GAD-7 in patients receiving brief, intensive CBT 
      treatment in a partial hospital setting. We also examined the properties of a 
      modified version that assessed symptoms over the past 24-h. METHODS: Participants 
      (n=1082) completed the GAD-7 upon admission and discharge from a partial hospital 
      program. They also completed measures of worry, depression, and well being and a 
      structured diagnostic interview. We examined psychometric properties in the total 
      sample and separately for patients with GAD, post-traumatic stress disorder, Social 
      Anxiety Disorder (SAD), and panic disorder. RESULTS: Internal consistency and 
      convergent validity were good for the total sample and each anxiety disorder group. 
      The GAD-7 demonstrated poor specificity and a high false positive rate for all 
      anxiety disorders. Sensitivity to change was generally good. Factor analysis 
      revealed that a one-factor structure did not fit the data well. The 24-h version 
      performed similarly to the original version. CONCLUSIONS: The GAD-7 performed well 
      as a measure of anxiety symptom severity, but not as a screener in this psychiatric 
      sample. It is a useful outcome measure for hetereogenous samples, but it may not 
      perform as well specifically for individuals with SAD. A modified version of the 
      GAD-7 that assessed anxiety symptoms over the past 24-h appears to be a reliable and 
      valid modification.

AB  - This study investigated whether intensive group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) with family involvement for children with anxiety disorders and 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) would facilitate children's return to their 
      daily routines. The focus shifted from the usual emphasis on remission to an 
      improvement in functioning. The aim was to capture potentially missed gains when 
      children pursue their fears and engage in more adaptive behaviors as these efforts 
      may result in ongoing symptoms. Two hundred twelve children and adolescents aged 
      8-19 years old, who were patients in an intensive outpatient group-based treatment 
      program at an academic hospital, participated in this study. Results indicated that 
      both children and their parents endorsed significant improvement in children's 
      functioning from admission to discharge. Symptom reduction was assessed for 
      reference, and both children and parents reported significant decreases in child 
      anxiety symptoms from admission to discharge, and children endorsed decreases in 
      their comorbid depression symptoms. Short-term group-based intensive treatment in a 
      clinical setting may help children return to their daily activities quickly.

TI  - A randomized, controlled trial of the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      and sertraline versus a waitlist control group for anxiety disorders in older 
      adults.
PG  - 255-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is the first to investigate the relative effectiveness of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with a selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline) in a randomized, controlled trial on the treatment of 
      anxiety disorders in older adults. METHOD: Eighty-four patients 60 years of age and 
      over with a principal diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, 
      agoraphobia, or social phobia were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 15 
      sessions of CBT, pharmacologic treatment with an SSRI (sertraline; maximum dosage 
      150 mg), or a waitlist control group. Participants completed measures of primary 
      outcome (anxiety) and coexistent worry and depressive symptoms at baseline, 
      posttreatment, and at three-month follow up. RESULTS: Attrition rates were high in 
      both treatment groups. Consequently, findings are based on a relatively small sample 
      of completers (N = 52). Although both CBT and sertraline led to significant 
      improvement in anxiety, worry, and depressive symptoms both at posttreatment and at 
      three-month follow up, sertraline showed superior results on worry symptoms. Effect 
      size estimates for CBT were in the small to medium range both at posttreatment (mean 
      d = 0.42) and at three-month follow up (mean d = 0.35), whereas effect sizes for 
      sertraline fell into the large range (posttreatment mean d = 0.94 and three-month 
      follow up mean d = 1.02). The waitlist condition showed virtually no effects 
      (posttreatment mean d = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly suggest that the 
      pharmacologic treatment of late-life anxiety with SSRIs has not been given the 
      proper attention in research to date.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for 
      panic disorder, but many fewer patients receive this treatment compared to 
      medication-based therapy. Mobile app-based interactive CBT using a chatbot can 
      increase patient access to CBT. We performed a preliminary study to determine 
      whether short-term use of a newly developed chatbot is feasible and effective for 
      relieving panic symptoms. METHOD: Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to 
      either a chatbot group (n = 21) or control group (n = 20) for a period of 4 weeks. 
      The chatbot group was guided in the use of the chatbot application, while the 
      control group was provided with a book on panic disorder. MAIN RESULTS: The severity 
      of panic disorder was significantly decreased in the chatbot group, but not in the 
      control group. The social phobia score was significantly decreased and the control 
      helplessness score was significantly increased in the chatbot group compared to the 
      control group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We found that mobile app-based interactive 
      CBT using the chatbot was feasible and effective for reducing the severity of panic 
      symptoms. Using this novel approach to provide CBT would allow clinicians to effect 
      positive therapeutic outcomes with easy accessibility, interactivity, and 
      self-management for patients with panic symptoms.

TI  - An investigation of cognitive-behavior therapy combined with oral valium for 
      children undergoing painful medical procedures.
PG  - 317-22
AB  - In previous research, a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) package was found to be 
      effective in reducing children's distress associated with the painful medical 
      procedures of bone marrow aspirations (BMAs) and lumbar punctures (LPs). Orally 
      administered Valium demonstrated less effectiveness but was helpful in reducing 
      behavioral distress before the medical procedure. In the present study, we 
      investigated whether the combination of oral Valium and CBT would result in 
      increased efficacy of the CBT. Eighty-three subjects were randomly assigned to 
      receive either CBT or CBT plus Valium while undergoing either a BMA or an LP. 
      Dependent variables included observed behavioral distress, self-reported fear and 
      pain, and pulse rate. Results failed to support the value of such a combination but 
      did provide additional evidence in regard to the effectiveness of the CBT. The need 
      for more potent medical interventions for some children is discussed.

TI  - Understanding the explanatory model of the patient on their medically unexplained 
      symptoms and its implication on treatment development research: a Sri Lanka Study.
PG  - 54
LID - 10.1186/1471-244X-8-54 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are often distressed, 
      disabled and dissatisfied with the care they receive. Illness beliefs held by 
      patients have a major influence on the decision to consult, persistence of symptoms 
      and the degree of disability. Illness perception models consist of frameworks to 
      organise information from multiple sources into distinct but interrelated 
      dimensions: identity (the illness label), cause, consequences, emotional 
      representations perceived control and timeline. Our aim was to elicit the illness 
      perceptions of patients with MUS in Sri Lankan primary care to modify and improve a 
      CBT intervention. METHOD: An intervention study was conducted in a hospital primary 
      care clinic in Colombo, Sri Lanka using CBT for MUS. As a part of the baseline 
      assessment, qualitative data was collected using; the Short Explanatory Model 
      Interview (SEMI), from 68 patients (16-65 years) with MUS. We categorised the 
      qualitative data in to key components of the illness perception model, to refine CBT 
      intervention for a subsequent larger trial study. RESULTS: The cohort was 
      chronically ill and 87% of the patients were ill for more than six months (range six 
      months to 20 years) with 5 or more symptoms and 6 or more visits over preceding six 
      months. A majority were unable to offer an explanation on identity (59%) or the 
      cause (56%), but in the consequence domain 95% expressed significant illness 
      worries; 37% believed their symptoms indicated moderately serious illness and 58% 
      very serious illness. Reflecting emotional representation, 33% reported fear of 
      death, 20% fear of paralysis, 13% fear of developing cancer and the rest unspecified 
      incurable illness. Consequence and emotional domains were significant determinants 
      of distress and consultations. Their repeated visits were to seek help to alleviate 
      symptoms. Only a minority expected investigations (8.8 %) or diagnosis (8.8%). 
      However, the doctors who had previously treated them allegedly concentrated more on 
      identity than cause. The above information was used to develop simple techniques 
      incorporating analogies to alter their perceptions CONCLUSION: The illness 
      perception model is useful in understanding the continued distress of patients with 
      persistent symptoms without an underlying organic cause. Hence it can make a 
      significant contribution when developing and evaluating culturally sensitive patient 
      friendly interventions.

TI  - Review of the long-term effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy compared to 
      medications in panic disorder.
PG  - 58-64
AB  - Panic disorder is a recurrent and disabling illness. It is believed that Cognitive 
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has a long-term protective effect for this disorder. This 
      would offer CBT considerable advantage over medication management of panic disorder, 
      as patients often relapse when they are tapered off their medications. This is a 
      review of the literature about the long-term effectiveness of CBT. We searched for 
      follow-up studies of panic disorder using CBT. Of the 78 citations produced in the 
      initial search, most had major methodological flaws, including ignoring losses to 
      follow-up, not accounting for interval treatment, and unclear reporting. Three 
      papers met strict methodological criteria, and two of these demonstrated a modest 
      protective effect of CBT in panic disorder patients. We make recommendations for 
      well-designed studies involving comparisons of medications and cognitive behavior 
      therapy.

TI  - Tailoring Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy to Treat Anxiety Comorbid with Advanced 
      Cancer.
PG  - 294-313
AB  - Patients with advanced cancer often experience debilitating anxiety symptoms that 
      interfere with quality of life and relate to worse medical outcomes. Although 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically-validated, first-line treatment 
      for anxiety disorders, clinical trials of CBT for anxiety typically exclude patients 
      with medical comorbidities in general, and those with terminal illnesses, such as 
      advanced cancer, in particular. Moreover, CBT has generally targeted unrealistic 
      fears and worries in otherwise healthy individuals with clinically significant 
      anxiety symptoms. Consequently, traditional CBT does not sufficiently address the 
      cognitive components of anxiety in patients with cancer, especially negative thought 
      patterns that are rational but nonetheless intrusive and distressing, such as 
      concerns about pain, disability and death, as well as management of multiple 
      stressors, changes in functional status and burdensome medical treatments. In this 
      paper, we describe a treatment approach for tailoring CBT to the needs of this 
      population. Three case examples of patients diagnosed with terminal lung cancer are 
      presented to demonstrate the treatment methods along with outcome measures for 
      anxiety and quality of life.

TI  - Assessing Breast Cancer Survivors' Perceptions of Using Voice-Activated Technology 
      to Address Insomnia: Feasibility Study Featuring Focus Groups and In-Depth 
      Interviews.
PG  - e15859
LID - 10.2196/15859 [doi]
LID - e15859
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors (BCSs) are a growing population with a higher 
      prevalence of insomnia than women of the same age without a history of cancer. 
      Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to be effective in 
      this population, but it is not widely available to those who need it. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to better understand BCSs' experiences with insomnia and to explore 
      the feasibility and acceptability of delivering CBT-I using a virtual assistant 
      (Amazon Alexa). METHODS: We first conducted a formative phase with 2 focus groups 
      and 3 in-depth interviews to understand BCSs' perceptions of insomnia as well as 
      their interest in and comfort with using a virtual assistant to learn about CBT-I. 
      We then developed a prototype incorporating participant preferences and CBT-I 
      components and demonstrated it in group and individual settings to BCSs to evaluate 
      acceptability, interest, perceived feasibility, educational potential, and usability 
      of the prototype. We also collected open-ended feedback on the content and used 
      frequencies to describe the quantitative data. RESULTS: We recruited 11 BCSs with 
      insomnia in the formative phase and 14 BCSs in the prototype demonstration. In 
      formative work, anxiety, fear, and hot flashes were identified as causes of 
      insomnia. After prototype demonstration, nearly 79% (11/14) of participants reported 
      an interest in and perceived feasibility of using the virtual assistant to record 
      sleep patterns. Approximately two-thirds of the participants thought lifestyle 
      modification (9/14, 64%) and sleep restriction (9/14, 64%) would be feasible and 
      were interested in this feature of the program (10/14, 71% and 9/14, 64%, 
      respectively). Relaxation exercises were rated as interesting and feasible using the 
      virtual assistant by 71% (10/14) of the participants. Usability was rated as better 
      than average, and all women reported that they would recommend the program to 
      friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: This virtual assistant prototype delivering CBT-I 
      components by using a smart speaker was rated as feasible and acceptable, suggesting 
      that this prototype should be fully developed and tested for efficacy in the BCS 
      population. If efficacy is shown in this population, the prototype should also be 
      adapted for other high-risk populations.

TI  - Exposure-Based CBT for Older Adults After Fall Injury: Description of a Manualized, 
      Time-Limited Intervention for Anxiety.
PG  - 432-445
AB  - Fall accidents among older adults can be devastating events that, in addition to 
      their physical consequences, lead to disabling anxiety warranting the attention of 
      mental health practitioners. This article presents "Back on My Feet," an 
      exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol that is designed for 
      older adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), subthreshold PTSD, or fear 
      of falling resulting from a traumatic fall. The protocol can be integrated into care 
      once patients have been discharged from hospital or rehabilitation settings back to 
      the community. Following a brief description of its development, the article 
      presents a detailed account of the protocol, including patient evaluation and the 
      components of the eight home-based sessions. The protocol addresses core symptoms of 
      avoidance, physiological arousal/anxiety, and maladaptive thought patterns. Because 
      older patients face different coping challenges from younger patients (for whom the 
      majority of evidence-based CBT interventions have been developed), the discussion 
      ends with limitations and special considerations for working with older, injured 
      patients. The article offers a blueprint for mental health practitioners to address 
      the needs of patients who may present with fall-related anxiety in primary care and 
      other medical settings. Readers who wish to develop their expertise further can 
      consult the online appendices, which include a clinician manual and patient 
      workbook, as well as guidance on additional resources.

TI  - Treatment choice for agoraphobic women: exposure or cognitive-behaviour therapy?
PG  - 409-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The paper describes a treatment trial where exposure was compared with 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy in the treatment of 39 female participants with a 
      diagnosis of agoraphobia (DSM-111-R). The primary objective of the study was to see 
      if cognitive therapy enhanced the effectiveness of exposure in the treatment of 
      agoraphobia. DESIGN: Participants were randomly assigned to either exposure or 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy. The two treatment groups were balanced for severity and 
      duration of agoraphobia, presence of panic disorder, and age. METHODS: The exposure 
      and the cognitive-behaviour therapy groups received the same amount of 
      therapist-assisted exposure to feared situations but the participants in the 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy group were, additionally, taught to identify and 
      challenge negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional assumptions. In the 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy condition exposure was presented as an opportunity to 
      identify and challenge negative thoughts. In the exposure condition, participants 
      were given a behavioural rationale for doing exposure. Participants were seen 
      individually for 10 sessions. Assessments were carried out before and after the 
      treatment programme and, also, six months later. Assessments included self-reports 
      of fear and avoidance, a behavioural test and questionnaire measures of relevant 
      cognitions. Thirteen participants dropped out of treatment leaving 14 in the 
      exposure condition and 12 in the cognitive-behaviour condition. Therapy sessions 
      were taped and a sample of tapes was given to a judge who rated the quality of the 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy. RESULTS: Substantial improvement was seen on virtually 
      all measures irrespective of treatment condition both at the end of treatment and 
      six months later. The cognitive-behaviour therapy group and the exposure group did 
      not differ significantly at post-treatment or at six-month follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term prognosis after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in 
      outpatient groups for panic disorder and agoraphobia is not well known. The purpose 
      of this study was to assess long-term outcomes in terms of psychological health, 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL), quality of life (QoL) and treatment 
      satisfaction after CBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia. METHODS: The sample 
      consisted of 68 patients (61% response rate), who were assessed at pretreatment; at 
      the start and end of treatment; and after 3 months, after 1 year, and over the long 
      term (M = 24 years; SD = 5.3; range: 12 to 31 years). The main outcome was the total 
      score on the Phobic Avoidance Rating Scale (PARS-total). At long-term follow-up, 
      HRQoL was measured with the RAND-12 questionnaire, and QoL was measured with two 
      questions from the "Study on European Union Statistics on Income and Living 
      Conditions". Patient experiences and treatment satisfaction were assessed by the 
      Generic Short Patient Experiences Questionnaire. A marginal longitudinal model was 
      applied to study the main outcome. RESULTS: The effect size of the long-term change 
      (mean change/ pooled SD) in the PARS-total score was (- 1.6, p < 0.001) and was 
      stable over time. A PARS-total score reduction of 50% was found in 98% of patients 
      at the long-term follow-up. The patients' HRQoL and QoL were similar to the expected 
      scores for the general Norwegian population. Of the patients, 95% reported high to 
      very high satisfaction with the CBT, and 93% reported large treatment benefits. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this study has the longest follow-up 
      after group CBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia, showing a good prognosis in ≥93% 
      of the participating patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The evidence for the efficacy of D-cycloserine (DCS) for augmenting 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders has been mixed. Guided by 
      preclinical research and initial findings from a small-scale study involving humans, 
      we tested the hypothesis that DCS enhancement of exposure therapy would be specific 
      to successful exposure sessions. METHOD: Medication-free adults with generalized 
      social anxiety disorder (N = 145) received 50 mg of DCS or placebo 1 h before each 
      of 5 exposure sessions that were part of a standardized 12-session group CBT 
      protocol. Participants provided fear ratings at the beginning and just before the 
      end of exposure exercises. Independent raters, blind to group assignment, 
      administered the clinical global impression improvement and severity scales at each 
      session and at posttreatment. RESULTS: Mixed-effects analyses revealed that, among 
      patients who reported low fear at the end of an exposure session, those who had 
      received DCS evidenced significantly greater clinical improvement at the next 
      session, relative to those who had received placebo. In contrast, when exposure end 
      fear was high, patients receiving DCS exhibited less clinical improvement at the 
      following session than patients receiving placebo. Similarly, patients who had 
      received DCS evidenced lower clinical severity at posttreatment, relative to 
      patients who had received placebo, only when their average end fear for 
      medication-augmented sessions had been in the low to moderate range. Finally, these 
      moderating effects of exposure success as indexed by end fear were not better 
      accounted for by within-session extinction. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of DCS for 
      augmenting exposure-based CBT depends on the success of exposure sessions. These 
      findings may help guide the development of an algorithm for the effective use of DCS 
      for augmenting exposure-based CBT. TRIAL REGISTRY: http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov,

TI  - Pragmatic evaluation of computer-aided self-help for anxiety and depression.
PG  - 57-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most anxiety/depression is not effectively treated. Aims Open evaluation 
      of a free clinic giving immediate computer-aided cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) 
      self-help plus brief advice from a therapist. METHOD: Test of outcome of 
      self-referrals who used one of four computer-aided CBT systems for depression, 
      phobia/panic, general anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder. RESULTS: The 
      equivalent of one full-time clinician managed 355 referrals over a year. Of the 266 
      who had a screening interview 79% were suitable. Completers and non-completers of 
      computer-aided CBT had similar pre-treatment features, with very chronic, moderately 
      severe problems. Completers of the computer-aided self-help had a mean total of an 
      hour's live therapist support over 12 weeks. They improved significantly and 
      clinically meaningfully with three of the four systems and felt 'fairly satisfied'. 
      Improvement resembled that in controlled and other trials of computer-aided CBT. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Computer-aided self-help is a 'clinician extender'that greatly cuts 
      per-patient therapist time without impairing improvement. It could reduce the 
      per-patient cost of CBT.

TI  - An open study of the effectiveness of Internet treatment for panic disorder 
      delivered in a psychiatric setting.
PG  - 44-50
LID - 10.1080/08039480802191132 [doi]
AB  - Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD/A) is common and can be treated 
      effectively with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication or 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT). However, the lack of access to CBT services has 
      motivated the development of self-help approaches requiring less therapist contact. 
      A novel treatment modality in this field, showing efficacy in several randomized 
      trials but until now not evaluated within the context of regular psychiatric care, 
      is Internet-based treatment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of Internet-based CBT for patients in a psychiatric setting. Twenty 
      consecutively referred patients with PD were included in the study. A structured 
      clinical interview with a psychiatrist was conducted for inclusion, as well as at 
      post-treatment and at the 6-month follow-up. The treatment consisted of a 10-week 
      CBT-based self-help programme, including minimal therapist support by e-mail. At 
      post-treatment, 94% of patients no longer met DSM-IV criteria for PD (82% at 6-month 
      follow-up). The within-group effect sizes (for the main outcome PDSS; Panic Disorder 
      Severity Scale) were Cohen's d=2.5 (pre- to post-treatment) and 2.8 (pre-treatment 
      to follow-up), respectively. The proportion of responders on the PDSS was 75% at 
      post-treatment and 70% at 6-month follow-up. The results supports earlier efficacy 
      data on Internet-based CBT for PD and indicates that it is effective also within a 
      regular psychiatric setting. However, a larger randomized controlled trial should be 
      conducted, directly comparing Internet-based CBT with traditionally administered CBT 
      within such a setting.

TI  - Computer-aided vs. tutor-delivered teaching of exposure therapy for phobia/panic: 
      randomized controlled trial with pre-registration nursing students.
PG  - 397-405
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure therapy is effective for phobic anxiety disorders (specific 
      phobias, agoraphobia, social phobia) and panic disorder. Despite their high 
      prevalence in the community, sufferers often get no treatment or if they do, it is 
      usually after a long delay. This is largely due to the scarcity of healthcare 
      professionals trained in exposure therapy, which is due, in part, to the high cost 
      of training. Traditional teaching methods employed are labour intensive, being based 
      mainly on role-play in small groups with feedback and coaching from experienced 
      trainers. In an attempt to increase knowledge and skills in exposure therapy, there 
      is now some interest in providing relevant teaching as part of pre-registration 
      nurse education. Computers have been developed to teach terminology and simulate 
      clinical scenarios for health professionals, and offer a potentially cost effective 
      alternative to traditional teaching methods. OBJECTIVE: To test whether student 
      nurses would learn about exposure therapy for phobia/panic as well by computer-aided 
      self-instruction as by face-to-face teaching, and to compare the individual and 
      combined effects of two educational methods, traditional face-to-face teaching 
      comprising a presentation with discussion and questions/answers by a specialist 
      cognitive behaviour nurse therapist, and a computer-aided self-instructional 
      programme based on a self-help programme for patients with phobia/panic called 
      FearFighter, on students' knowledge, skills and satisfaction. DESIGN: Randomised 
      controlled trial, with a crossover, completed in 2 consecutive days over a period of 
      4h per day. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-two mental health pre-registration nursing 
      students, of mixed gender, age and ethnic origin, with no previous training in 
      cognitive behaviour therapy studying at one UK university. RESULTS: The two teaching 
      methods led to similar improvements in knowledge and skills, and to similar 
      satisfaction, when used alone. Using them in tandem conferred no added benefit. 
      Computer-aided self-instruction was more efficient as it saved teacher preparation 
      and delivery time, and needed no specialist tutor. CONCLUSION: Computer-aided 
      self-instruction saved almost all preparation time and delivery effort for the 
      expert teacher. When added to past results in medical students, the present results 
      in nurses justify the use of computer-aided self-instruction for learning about 
      exposure therapy and phobia/panic and of research into its value for other areas of 
      health education.

TI  - Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety in Parkinson's Disease.
PG  - 552-579
LID - 10.1177/0145445519838828 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms, but nonmotor symptoms 
      also significantly impair daily functioning and reduce quality of life. Anxiety is 
      prevalent and debilitating in PD, but remains understudied and undertreated. Much 
      affective research in PD focuses on depression rather than anxiety, and as such, 
      there are no evidence-based treatments for anxiety in this population. 
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown promise for treating depression in PD 
      and may be efficacious for anxiety. This exploratory study implemented a 
      multiple-baseline single-case experimental design to evaluate the utility and 
      feasibility of CBT for individuals with PD who also met criteria for a DSM-5 anxiety 
      disorder (n = 9). Participants were randomized to a 2-, 4-, or 6-week baseline 
      phase, followed by 12 CBT sessions, and two post treatment assessments (immediately 
      post treatment and 6-week follow-up). Multiple outcome measures of anxiety and 
      depression were administered weekly during baseline and intervention. Weekly CBT 
      sessions were conducted in-person (n = 5) or via secure videoconferencing (n = 4). 
      At post treatment, seven of the nine participants showed significant reductions in 
      anxiety and/or depression, with changes functionally related to treatment and most 
      improvements maintained at 6-week follow-up. Effects of CBT on secondary outcomes 
      varied across participants, with preliminary evidence for reduction in fear of 
      falling. Adherence and retention were high, as were treatment satisfaction and 
      acceptability. The findings of this pilot study provide preliminary evidence for the 
      utility of CBT as a feasible treatment for anxiety and comorbid depressive symptoms 
      in PD and highlight the potential of telehealth interventions for mood in this 
      population.

TI  - Cognitive behavior therapy for hypochondriasis: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1464-70
AB  - CONTEXT: Hypochondriasis is a chronic, distressing, and disabling condition that is 
      prevalent in ambulatory medical practice. Until recently, no specific treatment has 
      been clearly demonstrated to be effective. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a 
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for hypochondriasis. DESIGN: A randomized, usual 
      care control group design, conducted between September 1997 and November 2001. The 
      individual primary care physician was the unit of randomization, and all patients 
      clustered within each physician's practice were assigned to the experimental 
      treatment (individual CBT and a consultation letter to the primary care physician) 
      or to the control condition. Subjects were assessed immediately before and 6 and 12 
      months after the completion of treatment. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants 
      were 80 patients from primary care practices and 107 volunteers responding to public 
      announcements, all of whom exceeded a predetermined cutoff score on a 
      hypochondriasis self-report questionnaire on 2 successive occasions. INTERVENTION: A 
      scripted, 6-session, individual CBT intervention was compared with medical care as 
      usual. The CBT was accompanied by a consultation letter sent to the patient's 
      primary care physician. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hypochondriacal beliefs, fears, 
      attitudes, and somatic symptoms; role function and impairment. RESULTS: A total of 
      102 individuals were assigned to CBT and 85 were assigned to medical care as usual. 
      The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were similar at 
      baseline. Using an intent-to-treat analytic strategy, a consistent pattern of 
      statistically and clinically significant treatment effects was found at both 6- and 
      12-month follow-up, adjusting for baseline covariates that included educational 
      level, generalized psychiatric distress, and participant status (patient vs 
      volunteer). At 12-month follow-up, CBT patients had significantly lower levels of 
      hypochondriacal symptoms, beliefs, and attitudes (P<.001) and health-related anxiety 
      (P =.009). They also had significantly less impairment of social role functioning (P 
      =.05) and intermediate activities of daily living (P<.001). Hypochondriacal somatic 
      symptoms were not improved significantly by treatment. CONCLUSION: This brief, 
      individual CBT intervention, developed specifically to alter hypochondriacal 
      thinking and restructure hypochondriacal beliefs, appears to have significant 
      beneficial long-term effects on the symptoms of hypochondriasis.

TI  - Impact of cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder on comorbidity: a 
      controlled investigation.
PG  - 959-70
AB  - This study examined the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for principal 
      panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, on comorbidity in 30 individuals (16 
      female). To test the hypothesis that improvements in co-existing conditions were not 
      due to spontaneous fluctuations across time, patients receiving immediate CBT were 
      compared to those assigned to wait list (n = 11). Results indicated clinician-rated 
      severity of comorbid specific phobia declined significantly following immediate CBT 
      compared to no change after wait list. The number of patients without comorbidity of 
      any severity increased after immediate CBT, with no such increase following wait 
      list. However, the groups did not differ in the frequency of additional diagnoses or 
      overall severity of comorbidity. In the total sample, results indicated reductions 
      in comorbidity by 9-month follow-up, with marked declines in the severity of 
      comorbid generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social and specific phobia. Our 
      findings suggest that targeted CBT for panic disorder has beneficial effects on 
      comorbidity over the longer term and that some of its immediate effects exceed those 
      due to the passage of time alone.

TI  - Protocol for the Optimune trial: a randomized controlled trial evaluating a novel 
      Internet intervention for breast cancer survivors.
PG  - 117
LID - 10.1186/s13063-019-3987-y [doi]
LID - 117
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Depression and fatigue are common in breast cancer survivors, and 
      their presence is associated with personal suffering and worse prognosis. While many 
      women receive short-term psychological support in the acute treatment phase, this is 
      rarely available in subsequent phases. Internet interventions for breast cancer 
      survivors could provide additional psychological support, as they are easily 
      accessible and may be effective. However, no trial has yet examined the 
      effectiveness of an Internet intervention that provides cognitive behavioural 
      therapy techniques plus lifestyle advice for this population. This trial aims to 
      test whether Optimune, a novel Internet intervention we developed for that purpose, 
      leads to improvements in quality of life and relevant lifestyle habits over the 
      course of 3 to 6 months. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will 
      include 360 female breast cancer survivors who have completed the active tumour 
      eradication phase. Participants will be recruited from various settings, including 
      web-based advertisements and Internet forums in German-speaking countries. The main 
      inclusion criteria are a breast cancer diagnosis less than 5 years ago and 
      completion of acute treatment at least 1 month ago, as verified by discharge letter 
      from an oncology treatment centre. Participants will be randomly assigned to either 
      (1) a control group, in which they receive care as usual (CAU) and are given access 
      to Optimune after a delay of 3 months (CAU/wait list control), or (2) a treatment 
      group that may also use CAU and will receive 12-month access to Optimune immediately 
      after randomization. The three primary endpoints are quality of life, physical 
      activity and diet quality, assessed with the World Health Organization Quality of 
      Life Questionnaire, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Food 
      Quality Questionnaire, at 3 months post-baseline; secondary outcomes include 
      cancer-related fatigue, emotional stress, depression, anxiety, fear of progression, 
      insomnia, usefulness of the programme and negative treatment effects. Online 
      assessments are conducted at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1) and 6 months (T2). 
      DISCUSSION: Results of this RCT are expected to extend the body of knowledge with 
      regard to the effectiveness of CBT-based Internet interventions for female breast 
      cancer survivors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03643640. Registered on

TI  - What treatments do patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia get?
PG  - 165-71
AB  - In a retrospective study 100 patients with DSM-III-R/ICD-10 panic disorder and 
      agoraphobia (PDA) were interviewed about the psychopharmacological, psychological 
      and 'alternative' treatments they had received in the course of their illness. 
      Patients gave global statements about how satisfied they were with the various 
      treatments they had experienced. Many patients received treatments that have never 
      been investigated under controlled conditions. The most common drug treatments, in 
      descending order, were: 48% benzodiazepines, 42% tricyclic antidepressants, 32% 
      herbal preparations, 29% neuroleptics, 7% selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      and 6% beta blockers. Of the drug prescriptions, 63% were according to international 
      standards. Of the neuroleptics, two-thirds (63.3%) were prescribed by nonpsychiatric 
      physicians, and only one-third by psychiatrists (33.3%). Tricyclic antidepressants 
      were prescribed more often by psychiatrists (64.7%) than by non-psychiatrists 
      (31.4%). Among psychological treatments, autogenic training (43% of the patients) 
      and psychodynamic therapy (33%) were used far more frequently than 
      behavioural/cognitive therapy (20%). These results confirm the underutilisation of 
      available effective treatments for panic disorder (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants or 
      behavioural therapy) and the overutilisation of treatments without proven efficacy 
      (e.g. herbal preparations or autogenic training). Patients were most satisfied with 
      treatments that have been proven effective in controlled studies. Among drug 
      treatments, benzodiazepines, selective serotonin inhibitors and tricyclic 
      antidepressants were favoured (mean on a 0-4 scale indicating effectiveness: 2.6, 
      2.6 and 2.4). Neuroleptics (1.4), beta-blockers (1.0) and herbal preparations (0.9) 
      were not rated highly effective by the patients. Among psychological treatments, 
      patients were more satisfied with behavioural/cognitive therapy (2.6) than with 
      psychodynamic therapies (1.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Protocol for a randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of an 
      online e health application for the prevention of Generalised Anxiety Disorder.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/1471-244X-10-25 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric 
      disorder. Effective prevention in young adulthood has the potential to reduce the 
      prevalence of the disorder, to reduce disability and lower the costs of the disorder 
      to the community. The present trial (the WebGAD trial) aims to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of an evidence-based online prevention website for GAD. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: The principal clinical question under investigation is the 
      effectiveness of an online GAD intervention (E-couch) using a community-based 
      sample. We examine whether the effect of the intervention can be maximised by either 
      human support, in the form of telephone calls, or by automated support through 
      emails. The primary outcome will be a reduction in symptoms on the GAD-7 in the 
      active arms relative to the non active intervention arms. DISCUSSION: The WebGAD 
      trial will be the first to evaluate the use of an internet-based cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) program contrasted with a credible control condition for 
      the prevention of GAD and the first formal RCT evaluation of a web-based program for 
      GAD using community recruitment. In general, internet-based CBT programs have been 
      shown to be effective for the treatment of other anxiety disorders such as Post 
      Traumatic Stress Disorder, Social Phobia, Panic Disorder and stress in clinical 
      trials; however there is no evidence for the use of internet CBT in the prevention 
      of GAD. Given the severe shortage of therapists identified in Australia and 
      overseas, and the low rates of treatment seeking in those with a mental illness, the 
      successful implementation of this protocol has important practical outcomes. If 
      found to be effective, WebGAD will provide those experiencing GAD with an easily 
      accessible, free, evidence-based prevention tool which can be promoted and 
      disseminated immediately.

TI  - Reliability of the self-report version of the panic disorder severity scale.
PG  - 183-5
AB  - The interview-administered Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) has been 
      demonstrated to be a reliable and valid measurement of panic disorder severity. The 
      purpose of this paper is to report on the reliability and usefulness of the 
      self-report form (PDSS-SR). The PDSS and PDSS-SR were administered to 108 
      psychiatric outpatients with and without panic disorder. The internal consistency of 
      the instruments was analyzed with Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was 
      assessed on 25 of these subjects by using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). 
      In addition, decrease in panic symptoms was measured after cognitive-behavioral 
      treatment (CBT) treatment on 27 subjects. Cronbach's alpha was.917 for PDSS-SR 
      and.923 for the PDSS. The PDSS-SR had good test-retest reliability (ICC=0.81) and 
      was sensitive to change with treatment, with a mean decrease of 7.3 (S.D.=5.1). The 
      self-report version of the PDSS is a reliable format, which could be useful in 
      clinical and research settings.

TI  - Treatment of anxiety disorders in primary care practice: a randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 763-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are prevalent in primary care. Psychological treatment 
      is effective but time-consuming, and there are waiting lists for secondary care. 
      Interest has therefore grown in developing guidelines for treatment that would be 
      feasible in primary care. AIM: To compare the effectiveness and feasibility of 
      guided self-help, the Anxiety Disorder Guidelines of the Netherlands College of 
      General Practitioners and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). DESIGN OF STUDY: 
      Randomised controlled study lasting 12 weeks with follow-up at 3 and 9 months for 
      primary care patients with panic disorder and/or generalised anxiety disorder. 
      SETTING: The first two forms of treatment were carried out by 46 GPs who were 
      randomly assigned to one or the other form. CBT was carried out by cognitive 
      behaviour therapists in a psychiatric outpatient clinic. METHOD: Participants (n = 
      154) were randomly assigned to one of the three forms of treatment. The main outcome 
      measure used was the state subscale of the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory. RESULTS: 
      All three forms of treatment gave significant improvement between pre-test and 
      post-test, and this improvement remained stable between post-test and the 
      follow-ups. The results obtained with the three treatment forms did not differ 
      significantly over time. The feasibility of the Anxiety Disorder Guidelines was low 
      compared with that of guided self-help. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that 
      primary care patients with prevalent anxiety disorders for whom the GP does not find 
      referral necessary can be adequately treated by the GP. Psychiatric outpatient 
      clinic referral does not give superior results. Guided self-help is easier for the 
      GP to carry out than a less highly-structured treatment like that laid down in the 
      Anxiety Disorder Guidelines.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy with gay, lesbian, and bisexual clients.
PG  - 629-43
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be adapted to a wide range of clinical 
      difficulties and presenting problems that face lesbians, gay men, and bisexual 
      persons. The following article presents general guidelines for and two case examples 
      of the use of CBT. The first case is a gay male struggling with social phobia. This 
      case is an example of how to adapt a structured, empirically supported 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment focusing on social phobia to situations that are 
      associated with his sexual orientation. The second is a woman struggling with 
      multiple issues including coming out. This case provides an example of how to add 
      specific cognitive-behavioral techniques to coming-out issues within the context of 
      a more eclectic, longer-term therapy.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment for specific phobias with a child demonstrating 
      severe problem behavior and developmental delays.
PG  - 546-58
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBTs) are widely used for anxiety disorders in 
      typically developing children; however, there has been no previous attempt to 
      administer CBT for specific phobia (in this case study, one-session treatment) to 
      developmentally or intellectually disabled children. This case study integrates both 
      cognitive-behavioral and behavior analytic assessment techniques in the CBT of water 
      and height phobia in a 7-year-old male with developmental delays and severe behavior 
      problems. One-session treatment [Ost, L. G. (1989). One-session treatment for 
      specific phobias. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 27, 1-7; Ost, L. G. (1997). Rapid 
      treatment of specific phobias. In G. C. L. Davey (Ed.), Phobias: A handbook of 
      theory, research, and treatment (pp. 227-247). New York: Wiley] was provided for 
      water phobia and then 2 months later for height phobia. The massed exposure therapy 
      sessions combined graduated in vivo exposure, participant modeling, cognitive 
      challenges, reinforcement, and other techniques. Both indirect and direct 
      observation measures were utilized to evaluate treatment efficacy. Results suggested 
      CBT reduced or eliminated behavioral avoidance, specific phobia symptoms, and 
      subjective fear. Negative vocalizations were reduced during height exposure 
      following treatment. Vocalizations following treatment for water phobia were less 
      clear and may have been indicative of typical 7-year-old protests during bath time. 
      Findings indicate CBT can be effective for treating clinical fears in an individual 
      with developmental disabilities and severe behavior. Future research in this 
      population should examine CBT as an alternative to other techniques (e.g., forced 
      exposure) for treating fears.

TI  - Effects of group experiential cognitive therapy for the treatment of panic disorder 
      with agoraphobia.
PG  - 387-93
AB  - A treatment protocol, called experiential cognitive therapy (ExCT), was developed. 
      It integrated traditional cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with virtual reality 
      exposure for the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA). The objective 
      of this study was to test the efficacy of short-term (four sessions) ExCT compared 
      with a traditional 12-session panic control program (PCP) for the treatment of PDA. 
      Forty patients diagnosed as having PDA by the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV were 
      randomly assigned to ExCT and PCP groups of 20 patients each. The treatment effects 
      were measured with self-report questionnaires, including the BDI, STAI, ASI, PBQ, 
      ACQ, and BSQ. The authors also assessed high end-state functioning (HES), including 
      the success rate of stopping or reducing medication at post-treatment and 6-month 
      follow-up. In all ratings, both ExCT and PCP groups showed significant improvement 
      post-treatment compared with pre-treatment scores. There were no significant 
      differences between the two treatment groups in HES and medication discontinuation 
      at post-treatment, but there was a significant difference in medication 
      discontinuation at 6-month follow-up. These results suggested that although 
      short-term effectiveness of ExCT might be comparable to the effectiveness of PCP, 
      long-term effectiveness of ExCT might be relatively inferior to the effectiveness of 
      PCP.

TI  - Body weight in bulimia nervosa.
PG  - 157-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine: 1) factors associated 
      with body mass index (BMI) in women with bulimia nervosa prior to treatment; 2) 
      changes in BMI during cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa; and 3) 
      predictors of weight change during CBT treatment. METHODS: Participants were 94 
      women with DSM-III-R bulimia nervosa enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of CBT. 
      Eating disorder symptomatology, past and current psychopathology, and BMI were 
      measured prior to treatment and after twelve weeks of treatment. RESULTS: A 
      significantly lower BMI prior to treatment was independently associated with a 
      history of anorexia nervosa, substance use, cigarette smoking, and a high frequency 
      of vomiting. Reductions in binge eating, purging, and food restriction after 
      treatment did not result in significant changes in BMI. Increasing age, higher 
      maximum lifetime body weight, and a high frequency of binge eating at baseline 
      predicted weight gain during treatment. Weight loss during treatment was predicted 
      by a high frequency of vomiting, and elevated levels of body dissatisfaction prior 
      to treatment. DISCUSSION: Patients hesitant to engage in treatment for fear of 
      weight gain upon cessation of their bulimic behaviors should be reassured that CBT 
      is not usually accompanied by substantial weight gain. Identification of women at 
      risk of significant weight gain or loss during CBT may enable therapists to focus on 
      its aspects that help to prevent excessive body weight changes.

TI  - Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
PG  - CD004690
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004690.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous Cochrane review (James 2005) showed that cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; 
      however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus non-CBT 
      active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and the 
      combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long-term effects of 
      CBT.  OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood 
      and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait-list controls; (b) 
      active non-CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, bibliotherapy and treatment 
      as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the combination of medication and CBT versus 
      placebo; and (2) the long-term effects of CBT. SEARCH METHODS: Searches for this 
      review included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the 
      Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant 
      randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases－The Cochrane Library 
      (1970 to July 2012), EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and 
      PsycINFO (1970 to July 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of CBT versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were 
      reviewed. All participants must have met the criteria of the Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for 
      an anxiety diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder and elective mutism. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers 
      independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the 
      odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects model, 
      with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was used. 
      Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child's anxiety symptoms 
      were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one 
      studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies 
      involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in 
      university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of 
      remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, 
      intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR 
      of 0.13 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.19, Z = 10.26, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate 
      heterogeneity (P = 0.04, I² = 33%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 6.0 (95% CI 
      7.5 to 4.6). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and 
      family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than 
      non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing 
      anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow-up 
      studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis 
      are not statistically significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural 
      therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; 
      however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or 
      TAU or medication at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive.

AB  - A recent published model described the phenomenon of a global panic reaction (GPR) 
      on the stock markets based on two remarkable stock market crashes in the months of 
      January and March [Sperling W, Bleich S, Reulbach U, Black Monday on stock markets 
      throughout the world - a new phenomenon of collective panic disorder? A psychiatric 
      approach. Med Hypotheses; 2008]. This model was completed by a therapeutic approach 
      following typical elements of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) [Sperling W, 
      Biermann T, Maler JM, Global panic reaction - a therapeutic approach to a world-wide 
      economic crisis. Med Hypotheses; 2009]. The phenomenon of a global panic reaction 
      due to economic crises seems to have even larger implications on human health as 
      well. It is well known that acute and chronic distress is competent to suppress the 
      immune system by various mechanisms that are discussed in detail. This global panic 
      reaction - that has also been observed in former times - might therefore be 
      responsible for the new variation of recent influenza pandemic coming from Mexico.

TI  - The Australian version of IAPT: clinical outcomes of the multi-site cohort study of 
      NewAccess.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/09638237.2020.1760224 [doi]
AB  - Background: The United Kingdom IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) 
      approach of delivering low intensity therapies for symptoms of depression and 
      anxiety was adapted for Australia and named NewAccess. Clinical outcomes of the 
      service were evaluated in three sites between October 2013 and 2016.Aims: This paper 
      describes the clinical outcomes in the Australian health setting.Methods: 
      Prospective cohort study with repeated measures. Both intent-to-treat and per 
      protocol analyses were conducted for primary outcomes measures Patient Health 
      Questionnaire-9 (nine item), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (seven item). 
      Secondary measures were Phobia Scale and Work and Social Adjustment Scale.Results: 
      Three thousand nine hundred and forty-six individuals were assessed, and 3269 
      attended at least two treatment sessions. Forty percent were males. There was a 
      clinically meaningful reduction (improvement) shown by reliable recovery rates in 
      both depression and anxiety symptoms at post-treatment assessment (68%; 95% CI: 
      66-70%) with large effect sizes (1.23 for depression and 1.25 for anxiety). Outcomes 
      in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were not influenced by age or sex, but recovery rates were 
      significantly reduced by relationship status (single or separated). Unemployment 
      reduced PHQ-9 outcomes but not GAD-7 outcomes.Conclusion: NewAccess demonstrated 
      positive clinical outcomes in Australia, that compared favourably with international 
      studies with the same methodology.

TI  - Predictors of response among patients with panic disorder treated with medications 
      in a naturalistic follow-up: the role of adult separation anxiety.
PG  - 675-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2011.10.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficacy of treatments for panic disorder is well established, but not 
      all patients respond. Adult separation anxiety has been found to predict poorer 
      response to CBT, but its effect on response to medication has not been previously 
      explored. STUDY AIM: The aim of this study is to investigate if panic-agoraphobic 
      spectrum factors, including 'separation anxiety' factor predict treatment outcome in 
      patients with panic disorder. STUDY SAMPLE: Participants who met criteria for PD 
      (n=57) completed baseline assessment and 12 months follow-up. Patients were 
      administered the Panic Agoraphobic Spectrum Self-Report (PAS-SR, Lifetime and 
      Last-Month Versions), and the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). We examined 
      patients who met the following criteria at baseline: 1) PDSS total score>7; 2) no 
      current Axis I comorbidity with major depression; 3) no lifetime or current bipolar 
      disorder. All patients were treated with evidence-based psychopharmacological 
      treatment for panic disorder during the 12-month observation period. RESULTS: Twenty 
      eight patients (48.1%) achieved remission during the follow-up period. In a logistic 
      regression model, controlling for baseline severity, gender and age, only the 
      last-month PAS-SR 'separation anxiety' factor was associated with a lower likelihood 
      of remission. CONCLUSIONS: Signs and symptoms of separation anxiety in adulthood, as 
      assessed with the PAS-SR Last Month version, are predictors of poor treatment 
      outcome in patients with PD. We submit that the assessment of panic-agoraphobic 
      spectrum features, including adult separation anxiety, should become routine of 
      clinical assessment of patients with PD. It is likely that a better 
      psychopathological characterization of patients may inform treatment selection, and 
      result in better treatment outcome.

TI  - Changes in anxiety sensitivity with pharmacotherapy for panic disorder.
PG  - 491-5
AB  - Fear of anxiety symptoms (anxiety sensitivity) has been implicated in the etiology 
      and maintenance of panic disorder, and has been shown to improve with 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment. The impact of pharmacotherapy on anxiety sensitivity 
      is less clear. We administered the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) during a 12-week 
      randomized controlled trial investigating the relative efficacy of paroxetine, 
      paroxetine plus sustained clonazepam, and paroxetine plus brief clonazepam for 
      patients with panic disorder. We found a mean reduction in ASI scores of 9.6 points, 
      which correlated with symptomatic improvement, and did not differ significantly 
      between groups. Our data provides further evidence that pharmacotherapy leads to 
      significant acute reductions in fears of anxiety symptoms in patients with panic 
      disorder, albeit at levels that may be somewhat less than the changes associated 
      with CBT. Implications of these findings are discussed relative to optimizing 
      pharmacologic treatment of panic disorder.

TI  - Anterior hippocampal volume predicts affect-focused psychotherapy outcome.
PG  - 396-402
LID - 10.1017/S0033291719000187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The hippocampus plays an important role in psychopathology and treatment 
      outcome. While posterior hippocampus (PH) may be crucial for the learning process 
      that exposure-based treatments require, affect-focused treatments might 
      preferentially engage anterior hippocampus (AH). Previous studies have distinguished 
      the different functions of these hippocampal sub-regions in memory, learning, and 
      emotional processes, but not in treatment outcome. Examining two independent 
      clinical trials, we hypothesized that anterior hippocampal volume would predict 
      outcome of affect-focused treatment outcome [Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT); 
      Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PFPP)], whereas posterior hippocampal 
      volume would predict exposure-based treatment outcome [Prolonged Exposure (PE); 
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT); Applied Relaxation Training (ART)]. METHODS: 
      Thirty-five patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 24 with panic 
      disorder (PD) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before 
      randomization to affect-focused (IPT for PTSD; PFPP for PD) or exposure-based 
      treatments (PE for PTSD; CBT or ART for PD). AH and PH volume were regressed with 
      clinical outcome changes. RESULTS: Baseline whole hippocampal volume did not predict 
      post-treatment clinical severity scores in any treatment. For affect-focused 
      treatments, but not exposure-based treatments, anterior hippocampal volume predicted 
      clinical improvement. Smaller AH correlated with greater affect-focused treatment 
      improvement. Posterior hippocampal volume did not predict treatment outcome. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore associations between hippocampal 
      volume sub-regions and treatment outcome in PTSD and PD. Convergent results suggest 
      that affect-focused treatment may influence the clinical outcome through the 
      'limbic' AH, whereas exposure-based treatments do not. These preliminary, 
      theory-congruent, therapeutic findings require replication in a larger clinical 
      trial.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of telephone-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      for late-life anxiety disorders.
PG  - 707-16
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Older adults face a number of barriers to receiving psychotherapy, such 
      as a lack of transportation and access to providers. One way to overcome such 
      barriers is to provide treatment by telephone. The purpose of this study was to 
      examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy delivered by telephone (CBT-T) 
      to older adults diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. DESIGN: Randomized controlled 
      trial. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty participants age 60 and 
      older with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or anxiety 
      disorder not otherwise specified. INTERVENTION: CBT-T versus information-only 
      comparison. MEASUREMENTS: Coprimary outcomes included worry (Penn State Worry 
      Questionnaire) and general anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory). Secondary 
      outcomes included clinician-rated anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), anxiety 
      sensitivity (Anxiety Sensitivity Index), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression 
      Inventory), quality of life (SF-36), and sleep (Insomnia Severity Index). 
      Assessments were completed prior to randomization, immediately upon completion of 
      treatment, and 6 months after completing treatment. RESULTS: CBT-T was superior to 
      information-only in reducing general anxiety (ES = 0.71), worry (ES = 0.61), anxiety 
      sensitivity (ES = 0.85), and insomnia (ES = 0.82) at the posttreatment assessment; 
      however, only the reductions in worry were maintained by the 6-month follow-up 
      assessment (ES = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CBT-T may be 
      efficacious in reducing anxiety and worry in older adults, but additional sessions 
      may be needed to maintain these effects.

TI  - Study protocol of the CAREST-trial: a randomised controlled trial on the (cost-) 
      effectiveness of a CBT-based online self-help training for fear of cancer recurrence 
      in women with curatively treated breast cancer.
PG  - 527
LID - 10.1186/s12885-016-2562-0 [doi]
LID - 527
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most prevalent long-term consequences of surviving breast 
      cancer is fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), which is associated with higher (mental) 
      healthcare costs and lower surveillance rates. The majority of breast cancer 
      survivors report a need for professional help in dealing with FCR. An 
      easy-accessible and cost-effective evidence-based psychological intervention for 
      reducing FCR is lacking. In the current study an online self-help training to reduce 
      FCR will be evaluated. In addition, the secondary aim of this study is to identify 
      factors that predict whether women can benefit from the online self-help training or 
      not. METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-centre, parallel-groups, randomised controlled trial 
      will be conducted to evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness of the CAREST-trial. A 
      sample of 454 women with curatively treated breast cancer will be recruited from 8 
      hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants will be randomised to the intervention or 
      usual care group (1:1). Self-report measures will be completed at baseline, 3 
      (post-intervention), 9, and 24 months. Primary outcome is FCR severity; secondary 
      outcomes are healthcare costs, health status, and psychological distress. The online 
      tailored self-help training "Less fear after cancer" is based on cognitive 
      behavioural therapy and consists of 2 basic modules (psycho-education; basic 
      principles of cognitive behavioural therapy) and 4 optional modules (rumination; 
      action; relaxation; reassurance) to choose from. Each module consists of an 
      informative part (texts, videos, audio files) and a practical part (exercises). For 
      every patient, the intervention will be available for three months. Personal online 
      support by an e-mail coach is available. DISCUSSION: Online self-help training may 
      be an easy-accessible and cost-effective treatment to reduce the impact of FCR at an 
      early stage in a large group of breast cancer survivors. A strength is the 24 months 
      follow-up period in the health economic evaluation. The results of the study will 
      provide information on the possible strengths and benefits of online self-help 
      training for FCR in breast cancer survivors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is 
      registered at the Netherlands Trial Register ( NTR4119 , date registered: August 15, 
      2013).

TI  - A preliminary study of D-cycloserine augmentation of cognitive-behavioral therapy in 
      pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 1073-6
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.07.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on the neural circuitry underlying fear extinction has led to 
      the examination of D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the amygdala, as a method to enhance exposure 
      therapy outcome. Preliminary results have supported the use of DCS to augment 
      exposure therapy in adult anxiety disorders; however, no data have been reported in 
      any childhood anxiety disorder. Thus, we sought to preliminarily examine whether 
      weight-adjusted DCS doses (25 or 50 mg) enhanced the overall efficacy of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder 
      (OCD). METHOD: Participants were 30 youth (aged 8-17) with a primary diagnosis of 
      OCD. The study design was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 
      augmentation trial examining CBT + DCS versus CBT + Placebo (15 youth per group). 
      All patients received seven exposure and response prevention sessions paired with 
      DCS or placebo taken 1 hour before sessions. RESULTS: Although not significantly 
      different, compared with the CBT + Placebo group, youth in the CBT + DCS arm showed 
      small-to-moderate treatment effects (d = .31-.47 on primary outcomes). No adverse 
      events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: These results complement findings in adult OCD 
      and non-OCD anxiety disorders and provide initial support for a more extensive study 
      of DCS augmentation of CBT among youth with OCD.

AB  - The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the acute-phase treatment of 
      panic disorder is well established. However, there are data to show CBT may not 
      always be able to prevent recurrence after treatment. The central cognitive 
      component of panic disorder psychopathology is thought to be hypersensitivity to 
      physical sensations. The present study reports that some aspects of interoceptive 
      hypersensitivity, gastrointestinal fears in particular, were predictive of the 
      course of panic disorder after end of CBT. Clinically it is suggested that new 
      interoceptive tasks related to gastrointestinal fears are needed.

TI  - Maintenance treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder: findings from a 
      naturalistic setting.
PG  - 25-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the utility of medication in the acute treatment of adult 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is well-established, the role of maintenance 
      therapy is not as well-studied. This study examines the efficacy of long-term 
      treatment for, and predictors of, stability in medicated patients with adult OCD. 
      METHODS: Using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), we 
      retrospectively evaluated 84 OCD patients who responded to a 10- to 12-week, 
      open-label, acute treatment in a naturalistic clinic setting. Patients were followed 
      based on their medication response for 1 to 92 months (mean 34.3), or until they 
      terminated therapy. We evaluated Y-BOCS scores every 6 months or sooner, if 
      clinically indicated. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients, 39 (46.4%) responded, having 
      relapsed within a 5-year period. Predictors of longer duration of stability were 
      adjunctive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), lack of comorbid disorders, lower 
      Y-BOCS score after treatment, and larger decrease in Y-BOCS score during treatment 
      phase. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the importance of maintenance treatment of OCD, 
      noting the benefits of long-term response to adjunctive CBT and of achieving maximal 
      acute response. It is becoming crucial to develop larger maintenance studies with 
      more uniform design to better assess the natural course of treated OCD and improve 
      treatment strategies.

      key maintenance factor for panic disorder (PD). Attentional bias may be an important 
      mechanism of symptom reduction, and thus, a useful target for optimizing outcomes. 
      The current study examined whether an attention bias modification (ABM) task 
      enhanced CBT outcomes. Multiple methods for assessing PD were used, including 
      physiological measurement and clinician-rated assessment. METHODS: Adults with panic 
      disorder (N = 24) received seven sessions of CBT with either ABM or sham attention 
      tasks. Psychophysiological reaction to a loud tones startle paradigm was assessed 
      before and after treatment. RESULTS: Across both groups, panic symptom severity 
      decreased with CBT. The ABM group showed greater reductions in PD symptoms compared 
      to the placebo group. Notably, however, changes in attentional bias were not 
      associated with symptom reductions across groups. No significant group differences 
      on psychophysiological assessment were observed. LIMITATIONS: This study is limited 
      by the small sample size, which rendered our power to investigate mediators and 
      moderators insufficient. More research is needed to validate the effect of attention 
      bias modification on attentional bias to threat. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study 
      suggests that future research should investigate attentional bias in conjunction 
      with CBT. A larger sample would provide opportunity to further investigate the 
      mechanisms through which ABM works, along with potential moderating factors and the 
      use of psychophysiological measurements in panic disorder.

AB  - Panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy (PFPP) is a 24-session, twice-weekly (12 
      weeks), manualized psychoanalytic psychotherapy with demonstrated preliminary 
      efficacy for panic disorder (PD).(,) Given the substantial morbidity and the health 
      care utilization of the PD population,(,) coupled with the sizable proportion of 
      such patients who do not respond (or respond inadequately) to alternate treatments 
      (cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] and drug therapy),(–) PFPP may offer clinicians 
      an additional tool for their therapeutic armamentarium. It may also facilitate a 
      rapprochement between academic psychiatry and psychodynamic perspectives, and a 
      reassessment of the role of psychodynamic therapy as part of the educational 
      experience of residents in training—an experience that has diminished over two 
      decades.

TI  - Cognitive-behavior therapy for discontinuation of SSRI treatment of panic disorder: 
      a case series.
PG  - 939-45
AB  - In this report we describe the outcome of eight outpatients with panic disorder and 
      agoraphobia who discontinued their treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitor (SSRI) in the context of a structured, group program of cognitive-behavior 
      therapy. All patients successfully discontinued their SSRI medication while 
      demonstrating clinical improvement. These results were maintained at 3-month 
      follow-up. This case series suggests that manualized CBT for discontinuation of 
      benzodiazepine treatment for panic disorder may be successfully applied to SSRI 
      discontinuation as well.

TI  - Panic disorder in the primary care setting: comorbidity, disability, service 
      utilization, and treatment.
PG  - 492-9; quiz 500
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased medical service utilization in patients with panic disorder 
      has been described in epidemiologic studies, although service use in primary care 
      panic patients relative to other primary care patients is less well characterized. 
      Inadequate recognition of panic has been shown in several primary care studies, 
      although the nature of usual care for panic in this setting has not been well 
      documented. This study aimed to document increased service use in panic patients 
      relative to other primary care patients and to characterize the nature of their 
      usual care for panic and their outcome. METHOD: Using a waiting room screening 
      questionnaire and follow-up telephone interview with the Composite International 
      Diagnostic Interview, we identified a convenience sample of 81 patients with panic 
      disorder (DSM-IV) and a control group of 183 psychiatrically healthy patients in 3 
      primary care settings on the West Coast and determined psychiatric diagnostic 
      comorbidity, panic characteristics, disability, and medical and mental health 
      service use, including medications. A subsample (N = 41) of panic patients was 
      reinterviewed 4-10 months later to determine the persistence of panic and the 
      adequacy of intervening treatment received using the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Disorders 
      Research Program study criteria for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and an 
      algorithm developed by the authors for medications. RESULTS: Seventy percent of 
      panic patients had a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. Patients had more disability in 
      the last month (days missed or cut down activities) (p < .01), more utilization of 
      emergency room and medical provider visits (p < .01), and more mental health visits 
      (p < .05). Despite the latter, only 42% received psychotropic medication, 36% 
      psychotherapy, and 64% any treatment. On follow-up, 85% still met diagnostic 
      criteria for panic, and only 22% had received adequate medication (type and/or dose) 
      and 12% adequate (i.e., CBT) psychotherapy. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a 
      need for improved treatment interventions for panic disorder in the primary care 
      setting to decrease disability and potentially inappropriate medical service 
      utilization.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioural interventions for children who have been sexually abused.
PG  - CD001930
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD001930.pub3 [doi]
LID - CD001930
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite differences in how it is defined, there is a general consensus 
      amongst clinicians and researchers that the sexual abuse of children and adolescents 
      ('child sexual abuse') is a substantial social problem worldwide. The effects of 
      sexual abuse manifest in a wide range of symptoms, including fear, anxiety, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder and various externalising and internalising behaviour 
      problems, such as inappropriate sexual behaviours. Child sexual abuse is associated 
      with increased risk of psychological problems in adulthood. Cognitive-behavioural 
      approaches are used to help children and their non-offending or 'safe' parent to 
      manage the sequelae of childhood sexual abuse. This review updates the first 
      Cochrane review of cognitive-behavioural approaches interventions for children who 
      have been sexually abused, which was first published in 2006. OBJECTIVES: To assess 
      the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural approaches (CBT) in addressing the immediate 
      and longer-term sequelae of sexual abuse on children and young people up to 18 years 
      of age. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials (CENTRAL) (2011 Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to November Week 3 2011); EMBASE 
      (1980 to Week 47 2011); CINAHL (1937 to 2 December 2011); PsycINFO (1887 to November 
      Week 5 2011); LILACS (1982 to 2 December 2011) and OpenGrey, previously OpenSIGLE 
      (1980 to 2 December 2011). For this update we also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and 
      the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). SELECTION CRITERIA: We 
      included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of CBT used with children 
      and adolescents up to age 18 years who had experienced being sexually abused, 
      compared with treatment as usual, with or without placebo control. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of 
      titles and abstracts identified in the search. Two review authors independently 
      extracted data from included studies and entered these into Review Manager 5 
      software. We synthesised and presented data in both written and graphical form 
      (forest plots). MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 trials, involving 847 participants. All 
      studies examined CBT programmes provided to children or children and a non-offending 
      parent. Control groups included wait list controls (n = 1) or treatment as usual (n 
      = 9). Treatment as usual was, for the most part, supportive, unstructured 
      psychotherapy. Generally the reporting of studies was poor. Only four studies were 
      judged 'low risk of bias' with regards to sequence generation and only one study was 
      judged 'low risk of bias' in relation to allocation concealment. All studies were 
      judged 'high risk of bias' in relation to the blinding of outcome assessors or 
      personnel; most studies did not report on these, or other issues of bias. Most 
      studies reported results for study completers rather than for those 
      recruited.Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and child 
      behaviour problems were the primary outcomes. Data suggest that CBT may have a 
      positive impact on the sequelae of child sexual abuse, but most results were not 
      statistically significant. Strongest evidence for positive effects of CBT appears to 
      be in reducing PTSD and anxiety symptoms, but even in these areas effects tend to be 
      'moderate' at best. Meta-analysis of data from five studies suggested an average 
      decrease of 1.9 points on the Child Depression Inventory immediately after 
      intervention (95% confidence interval (CI) decrease of 4.0 to increase of 0.4; I(2) 
      = 53%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.08), representing a small to moderate effect 
      size. Data from six studies yielded an average decrease of 0.44 standard deviations 
      on a variety of child post-traumatic stress disorder scales (95% CI 0.16 to 0.73; 
      I(2) = 46%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.10). Combined data from five studies 
      yielded an average decrease of 0.23 standard deviations on various child anxiety 
      scales (95% CI 0.3 to 0.4; I(2) = 0%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.84). No study 
      reported adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions of this updated 
      review remain the same as those when it was first published. The review confirms the 
      potential of CBT to address the adverse consequences of child sexual abuse, but 
      highlights the limitations of the evidence base and the need for more carefully 
      conducted and better reported trials.

AB  - The fear of painful procedures is at an increased incidence within the pediatric 
      population. This can be an extremely challenging obstacle in dermatology where 
      injections, blood draws, and cryotherapy are often required during the care of 
      patients. Psychologic techniques based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be 
      implemented leading up to and while performing these procedures to help reduce 
      patient anxiety.

TI  - One- vs. five-session treatment of intra-oral injection phobia: a randomized 
      clinical study.
PG  - 279-85
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0722.2009.00628.x [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of one and five sessions of treatment 
      for intra-oral injection phobia in 55 subjects fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria for 
      specific phobia. The subjects were randomly assigned to one or five sessions of 
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) performed by dentists. Assessments included 
      behavioural tests and self-report instruments used pretreatment, post-treatment, and 
      at 1 yr of follow-up. The dental anxiety scale (DAS), the injection phobia 
      scale-anxiety, and the mutilation questionnaires were applied. Mean avoidance 
      duration of intra-oral injections before treatment was 7.0 yr. The results showed 
      that 89% of the subjects had received intra-oral injections from a regular dentist 
      during the 1-yr follow-up. The only significant difference between the one- and the 
      five-session groups was that the five-session group reported less anxiety (as 
      measured using the DAS) at 1 yr of follow-up. It was concluded that both treatments 
      performed by dentists specially trained in CBT have a significant treatment effect 
      on the intra-oral injection phobia.

TI  - Linking neuroscience theory to practice to help overcome student fear of neurology.
PG  - 651-3
AB  - Reports in the literature have attributed medical student fear of neurology to an 
      inability to apply knowledge of the basic science to clinical situations. A teaching 
      and learning initiative called case based teaching (CBT) was designed to help 
      medical undergraduates integrate clinical neurology with the neuroscience that 
      underpins it. In the context of the evaluation of a neurological case, students 
      learned the correct technique for eliciting a large number of signs and symptoms, 
      while applying their understanding of normal structure and function to interpret and 
      understand the history, examination and investigation findings. Students were very 
      positive about the practical, problem-solving, small group-learning environment, 
      reporting that it facilitated the integration of nervous system structure and 
      function with clinical medicine. Some admitted to a fear of neurology, which was 
      helped by the limited initiative, but requested more CBT sessions to reduce their 
      neurophobia. Many eminent groups in neurology education recommend integration of 
      teaching in basic science and clinical neurology, and this report indicates that 
      medical undergraduates value this approach too.

TI  - Improving outcomes for patients with medication-resistant anxiety: effects of 
      collaborative care with cognitive behavioral therapy.
PG  - 1099-1106
LID - 10.1002/da.22574 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with anxiety disorders remain symptomatic after receiving 
      evidence-based treatment, yet research on treatment-resistant anxiety is limited. We 
      evaluated effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on outcomes of patients with 
      medication-resistant anxiety disorders using data from the Coordinated Anxiety 
      Learning and Management (CALM) trial. METHODS: Primary care patients who met study 
      entry criteria (including DSM-IV diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic 
      disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or social anxiety disorder) despite ongoing 
      pharmacotherapy of appropriate type, dose, and duration were classified as 
      medication resistant (n = 227). Logistic regression was used to estimate effects of 
      CALM's CBT program (CALM-CBT; chosen by 104 of 117 medication-resistant patients 
      randomized to CALM) versus usual care (UC; n = 110) on response [≥ 50% reduction of 
      12-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-12) anxiety and somatic symptom score] and 
      remission (BSI-12 < 6) at 6, 12, and 18 months. Within-group analyses examined 
      outcomes by treatment choice (CBT vs. CBT plus medication management) and CBT dose. 
      RESULTS: Approximately 58% of medication-resistant CALM-CBT patients responded and 
      46% remitted during the study. Relative to UC, CALM-CBT was associated with greater 
      response at 6 months (AOR = 3.78, 95% CI 2.02-7.07) and 12 months (AOR = 2.49, 95% 
      CI 1.36-4.58) and remission at 6, 12, and 18 months (AORs = 2.44 to 3.18). Patients 
      in CBT plus medication management fared no better than those in CBT only. Some 
      evidence suggested higher CBT dose produced better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: CBT can 
      improve outcomes for patients whose anxiety symptoms are resistant to standard 
      pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment of panic attacks in chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - Although panic attacks have been described as relatively common in schizophrenia, 
      few studies have examined treatments for this problem. Because cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy for panic disorder without schizophrenia, 
      the authors conducted an open clinical trial of CBT for the treatment of panic 
      attacks in schizophrenic patients. Eight patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for 
      schizophrenia and panic disorder were given a 16-week clinical trial of CBT. Ratings 
      after treatment demonstrated both a statistically significant reduction in panic 
      symptoms and a diminution in the number of panic attacks compared with baseline 
      ratings. These results suggest use of CBT in the integrated treatment of patients 
      with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and panic disorder is a promising approach that 
      merits further investigation.

TI  - Transporting an empirically supported treatment for panic disorder to a service 
      clinic setting: a benchmarking strategy.
PG  - 231-9
AB  - This work examines the transportability of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
      panic disorder to a community mental health center (CMHC) setting by comparing CMHC 
      treatment outcome data with the results obtained in two controlled efficacy trials. 
      Participants were 110 clients with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder with or 
      without agoraphobia; clients were not excluded on the basis of medication use or 
      changes, severity or frequency of panic attacks, age, or the presence of 
      agoraphobia. Clients completed a 15-session CBT protocol. Despite differences in 
      settings, clients, and treatment providers, the treatment outcomes for clients 
      completing treatment in the CMHC and the efficacy studies were comparable: Of the 
      CMHC clients who completed treatment, 87% were panic-free at the end of treatment, 
      and clients showed significant reductions in anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobic 
      avoidance, generalized anxiety, and symptoms of depression. The present study 
      suggests that panic control treatment can be transported to a CMHC. Challenges 
      facing the transportability of research-based treatment to CMHC clients, settings, 
      and treatment providers are discussed.

TI  - The role of bibliotherapy in health anxiety: an experimental study.
PG  - 498-504
AB  - Despite its high prevalence and implications for health care resources, health 
      anxiety is generally considered difficult and expensive to manage. Structured 
      self-help materials (bibliotherapy) using a cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) 
      treatment approach have been shown to be clinically effective. This experimental 
      study investigated the effects of bibliotherapy on patients who had been identified 
      as demonstrating health concerns. The 40 participants (patients drawn from GP 
      surgeries) were randomly allocated to two groups, one receiving bibliotherapy and 
      the other not. Half the patients had a medically diagnosed problem. Anxiety was 
      assessed before and after the bibliotherapy intervention, which took the form of a 
      cognitive-behavioural self-help booklet for health anxiety sufferers. Patients in 
      the bibliotherapy group showed reduced levels of anxiety at post-test, even when 
      they also had an identifiable physical problem. These results are consistent with 
      the idea that self-help materials can be an effective and accessible intervention in 
      CBT, although further research is recommended.

TI  - The effectiveness of anxiety treatment on alcohol-dependent patients with a comorbid 
      phobic disorder: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 794-800
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evidence has emerged which indicates that the post-treatment relapse rate 
      for alcohol-dependent patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder is higher than for 
      alcohol-dependent patients without a comorbid anxiety disorder. The question raised 
      by this evidence is whether the relapse rate in these dually diagnosed patients 
      could be reduced if they were given additional treatment for the comorbid anxiety 
      disorder. We attempted to answer this question by conducting a trial among patients 
      with a double diagnosis of alcohol dependence and agoraphobia or social phobia. 
      METHOD: We conducted a 32-week randomized controlled trial among 96 abstinent 
      patients with a primary diagnosis of alcohol dependence and a comorbid anxiety 
      disorder involving agoraphobia or social phobia. The patients were randomly assigned 
      to an intensive psychosocial relapse-prevention program on its own (n = 49) or in 
      combination with an anxiety treatment program comprising cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) and optional pharmacotherapy consisting of an SSRI (n = 47). The 
      primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients who suffered an alcohol 
      relapse during a 32-week period. The secondary outcome measures were total 
      abstinence, a reduction in the days of heavy drinking, and less severe anxiety 
      symptoms. RESULTS: Although the additional therapy clearly reduced the anxiety 
      symptoms, it had no significant effect on the alcohol relapse rates. CONCLUSION: 
      Anxiety treatment for alcohol-dependent patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder 
      can alleviate anxiety symptoms, but it has no significant effect on the outcome of 
      alcohol treatment programs.

TI  - Treatment of child anxiety: an exploratory study of the role of maternal anxiety and 
      behaviours in treatment outcome.
PG  - 38-44
LID - 10.1002/cpp.559 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders are common among parents of anxious children and have been found 
      to impede child treatment outcomes, yet it is unclear whether it is parental anxiety 
      that needs to be targeted in therapy or associated parental behaviours. Twenty-two 
      children (6-12 years) with a current anxiety disorder and their mothers received 
      cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) for child anxiety. In addition, of the 12 
      mothers who met criteria for a current anxiety disorder, 6 received CBT for their 
      own disorder. Assessments were made of the mother-child interaction. The main 
      findings were: (1) children did less well from treatment where their mothers had a 
      current anxiety disorder; (2) treatment of maternal anxiety disorder did not improve 
      child treatment outcome; and (3) maternal overinvolvement and expression of fear was 
      associated with child treatment outcome. The results suggest that in the context of 
      maternal anxiety disorder, child treatment outcome may be improved by specifically 
      targeting parenting behaviours.

TI  - Determinants of long-term response to group therapy for dysfunctional fear of 
      progression in chronic diseases.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/08964289.2011.640364 [doi]
AB  - Prior work demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral (CBT) and supportive-experiential 
      (SET) group interventions can reduce dysfunctional fear of progression (FoP) in 
      patients with chronic diseases. In this secondary analysis of a randomized 
      controlled study, we investigated determinants of long-term response to group 
      therapy for FoP. Response to therapy after 12 months was assessed using the Reliable 
      Change Index (RCI). Outcome data were available for 129 patients with cancer and 116 
      patients with chronic arthritis. 37.9% of the patients in the CBT group and 32.7% of 
      those attending the SET group indicated response to therapy (p=.402). Educational 
      level predicted long-term response to therapy (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.33-4.81; p=.005). 
      Medical patients with lower education may need additional attention in order to gain 
      long-lasting benefit from brief group psychotherapy. However, this investigation 
      needs to be replicated in a study that includes a broader range of psychological 
      predictors.

TI  - Social anxiety disorder. A guide for primary care physicians.
PG  - 176-8
AB  - Social anxiety disorder is prevalent, potentially disabling, but quite treatable. A 
      thorough and directed history can distinguish social phobia from depression, panic 
      disorder, and OCD. It can also screen for and identify possible substance abuse. 
      Once the diagnosis is made, a combination of pharmacologic and psychotherapy is 
      indicated. The SSRIs, MAOIs, benzodiazepines, and beta-blockers--as well as CBT--can 
      effectively treat social anxiety symptoms. Primary care physicians may well want to 
      begin by prescribing an SSRI like paroxetine, along with a high potency 
      benzodiazepine to be taken on a regular or an as-needed basis, and a beta-blocker to 
      take as needed in anticipation of stressful social situations. A referral for CBT 
      should be considered. If the patient has marked side effects from drug treatment or 
      a lack of adequate response to medication, psychiatric referral is definitely 
      indicated.

      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 787
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00787 [doi]
LID - 787
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The fear of childbirth (FOC) has an adverse effect on the physical and 
      mental health of pregnant women and increases adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. 
      Previous research reported the effect of psychological interventions such as 
      cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation therapies, and short-term 
      psycho-educational intervention on FOC. We examined whether adding motivational 
      interviewing (MI) psychotherapy to prenatal usual care (PUC) is superior to PUC 
      alone to reduce the scores of FOC, pregnancy stress, and self-efficacy. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: An RCT with two-arm parallel groups and 1:1 allocation ratio assigned 
      70 pregnant women (aged 18-50) attending public health centers in an education 
      hospital in Iran to receive five sessions of group MI psychotherapy plus PUC (N = 
      35) or to receive PUC alone (N = 35). The primary outcomes were the FOC scores 
      (Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire, W-DEQ), pregnancy-specific 
      stress (Prenatal Distress Questionnaire, NuPDQ), anxiety (Spielberger state 
      anxiety), and Childbirth Self-Efficacy Index (CBSI) at 5 weeks post-randomization. 
      Additional measures included subscales of the W-DEQ and the NuPDQ, patients' 
      compliance, and satisfaction with psychotherapy intervention at 5 weeks 
      post-randomization as secondary outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: The post-trial results 
      indicated that the outcome scores diminished more considerably in psychotherapy than 
      in PUC for total FOC scale with a large effect size (B = -23.54, p = < 0.001, 
      η(2)η(2) = 0.27), for total pregnancy stress with a large effect size (B = -4.51, p 
      = < 0.001, η(2) = 19), and for state anxiety with a large effect size (B = -12.42, p 
      = < 0.001, η(2) = 0.22). However, the score of self-efficacy and concern about 
      physical symptoms did not differ between the psychotherapy and PUC groups (P < 
      0.05). DISCUSSION: Adding 5 weeks of group psychotherapy to PUC could be considered 
      as an adjunctive care option for reducing FOC, pregnancy stress, and general anxiety 
      in pregnant women in the third trimester. Future research may focus on sustaining 
      the effects and evaluating the economic impacts of adding psychotherapy to PUC.

      Behavior Therapy for Acrophobia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - E1614 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9061614 [doi]
AB  - This study examined user engagement with ZeroPhobia, a self-guided app-based virtual 
      reality (VR) Cognitive Behavior Therapy for acrophobia symptoms using cardboard VR 
      viewers. Dutch acrophobic adults (n = 96) completed assessments at baseline and 
      immediately following treatment. Primary outcome measures were the Acrophobia 
      Questionnaire (AQ) and the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ). Usage data consisted 
      of number of VR sessions practiced, practice time, and fear ratings directly after 
      practicing. Results show that of the 66 participants who played at least one level, 
      the majority continued to finish all levels, spending on average 24.4 min in VR. 
      Self-reported fear consistently decreased between the start and finish of levels. 
      Post-test AQ scores depended quadratically on time spent in VR. Higher pre-test AQ 
      scores were significantly associated with subjective anxiety after the first level 
      and a reduction of post-test AQ scores, but not with number of sessions, suggesting 
      it might be more beneficial to play one level for a longer time period instead of 
      practicing many VR levels. Results also show an optimum exposure level at which 
      increasing practice time does not result in increased benefit. Self-guided VR 
      acrophobia treatment is effective and leads to consistent reductions in 
      self-reported anxiety both between levels and after treatment. Most participants 
      progressed effectively to the highest self-exposure level, despite the absence of a 
      therapist.

TI  - Psychological treatment of noncardiac chest pain: the cognitive approach.
PG  - 114S-121S
AB  - Chest pain often accompanies panic attacks. The success of cognitive therapy in the 
      treatment of panic disorder has led to effective cognitive--behavioral therapy for 
      both anxiety about health and noncardiac chest pain accompanied by anxiety. The 
      cognitive hypothesis proposes that, in vulnerable persons, sensations in the chest 
      region can be misinterpreted as a sign of serious illness, such as an impending 
      heart attack, giving rise to anxiety. A variety of responses can contribute to the 
      problem of such misinterpretations and the associated anxiety. First, 
      anxiety-induced autonomic arousal can generate an increase in symptoms. Second, 
      worried patients are more likely to focus on their bodily reactions and to check 
      their bodily functioning, increasing the likelihood that some changes will be 
      detected. Third, patients may seek medical evaluation or other forms of reassurance, 
      which can lead to further misinterpretation and worry. Each of these reactions can 
      increase the perception of chest pain, contributing to a vicious cycle that 
      exacerbates both the chest pain and the anxiety. In most cases, treatment is 
      straightforward. It starts with identification of the patient's particular fears, 
      followed by education about the role of anxiety in producing physical sensations 
      such as chest pain. Demonstration of the processes that produce and maintain 
      physical sensations usually convinces the patient of the harmless nature of 
      symptoms. Although cognitive therapy avoids giving reassurance by "ruling out" 
      feared diseases, patients are encouraged to take actions to disconfirm their worst 
      fears. Some patients require more specialized treatment, particularly if they remain 
      strongly convinced that their problem is solely physical. Such patients must be 
      engaged in active collaboration with the therapist.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy delays relapse in female socially phobic alcoholics.
PG  - 333-45
AB  - The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that socially phobic 
      alcoholics treated with Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT) will have better drinking 
      outcomes than those treated with Twelve-Step Facilitation therapy (TSF). Three 
      hundred ninety-seven treatment-seeking alcoholics with concurrent social phobia were 
      compared retrospectively to a matched sample of 397 alcoholics without social 
      phobia. Treatment was delivered in an outpatient setting, and patients were 
      randomized to either CBT, TSF, or Motivational Enhancement therapy (MET). The groups 
      were compared on self-reported drinking measures (e.g., quantity and frequency of 
      drinking, and time-to-event measures) during treatment period and monthly for 1 year 
      following treatment. Survival analyses revealed that female outpatients with social 
      phobia showed delayed relapse to drinking when treated with CBT rather than TSF; the 
      reverse was true for female outpatients without social phobia. Survival analyses in 
      male outpatients with and without social phobia revealed an opposite trend, though 
      it was not statistically significant. These data suggest that Cognitive Behavioral 
      therapy is superior to Twelve-Step Facilitation therapy for the treatment of alcohol 
      problems in specific populations. namely socially phobic women seeking outpatient 
      treatment.

TI  - Processes of therapeutic change: Results from the Cornell-Penn Study of 
      Psychotherapies for Panic Disorder.
PG  - 222-231
LID - 10.1037/cou0000417 [doi]
AB  - To examine process of changes in two distinct psychotherapies-cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) and Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PFPP). Two hypothesized 
      processes of change-misinterpretation of bodily sensations and Panic Specific 
      Reflective Function (PSRF)-were tested in the CBT and PFPP arms of the Cornell-Penn 
      Study of Psychotherapies for Panic Disorder. The Brief Bodily Sensations 
      Interpretation Questionnaire (BBSIQ) measures misinterpretation of bodily 
      sensations-a focus of CBT interventions. PSRF, a target of PFPP, assesses the 
      capacity to reflect on the underlying meaning of panic symptoms. A sample of 138 
      patients (37.7% men, 72.56% Whites, and 16.7% Latinx) with primary Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) panic disorder were 
      included in the present analyses. Mixed effects models tested the effects of early 
      change in BBSIQ and PSRF (intake through Week 5) on subsequent change in the Panic 
      Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS; Week 5 through termination). Early change on both 
      PSRF and BBSIQ predicted subsequent change in panic severity across the two 
      treatments. As predicted, PSRF changed more in PFPP than in CBT, but, contrary to 
      expectation, BBSIQ showed comparable changes in both groups. Counterintuitively, CBT 
      patients benefited more in terms of panic symptom improvement when their PSRF 
      improved than did PFPP patients. This is the first demonstration of general 
      processes of change (PSRF and BBSIQ) across psychotherapies for panic disorder, 
      suggesting that to the extent patients change their beliefs about the meaning of 
      panic, their panic symptoms improve in time-limited, panic-focused psychotherapies.

TI  - Half of obsessive-compulsive disorder cases misdiagnosed: vignette-based survey of 
      primary care physicians.
PG  - e761-7
LID - 10.4088/JCP.14m09110 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Medical settings are the primary mode of care for mental health problems; 
      physicians' abilities with regard to psychiatric diagnosis and treatment 
      recommendations are therefore essential. While misdiagnosis can occur across all 
      psychiatric conditions, the heterogeneous nature of obsessive-compulsive disorder 
      (OCD) may make this condition at an elevated risk for misidentification. The study's 
      aim was to assess primary care physicians' ability to identify OCD. METHOD: The 
      study was cross-sectional in design. An online, vignette-based survey was emailed to 
      1,172 physicians from 5 major medical hospitals in the Greater New York Area. The 
      email included a link to the survey, which consisted of 1 of 8 randomized OCD 
      vignettes; each vignette focused on one of the following common manifestations of 
      OCD: obsessions regarding aggression, contamination, fear of saying things, 
      homosexuality, pedophilia, religion, somatic concerns, or symmetry. Participants 
      provided diagnostic impressions and treatment recommendations for the individual 
      described in the vignette. Data collection took place from December 10, 2012, 
      through January 18, 2013. RESULTS: Two hundred eight physicians completed the 
      survey. The overall misidentification rate was 50.5%. Vignette type was the 
      strongest predictor of a correct OCD response (Wald χ(2)7 = 40.58; P <.0001). 
      Misidentification rates by vignette were homosexuality (84.6%), aggression (80.0%), 
      saying certain things (73.9%), pedophilia (70.8%), somatic concerns (40.0%), 
      religion (37.5%), contamination (32.3%), and symmetry (3.70%). Participants who 
      misidentified the OCD vignette were less likely to recommend a first-line 
      empirically supported treatment (cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] = 46.7%, 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] = 8.6%) compared to participants who 
      correctly identified the OCD vignette (CBT = 66.0%, SSRI = 35.0%). Antipsychotic 
      recommendation rates were elevated among incorrect versus correct responders (12.4% 
      vs 1.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated OCD misdiagnosis rates and the impact of incorrect 
      diagnoses on treatment recommendations highlight the need for greater training 
      regarding OCD symptomatology and empirically supported treatments.

PG  - 369-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the effects of 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) on mental health status and healthcare 
      utilization in patients with somatoform disorders (SFD) of a specialized tertiary 
      care center. METHODS: According to DSM-IV interviews, 54 patients had somatization 
      disorder (SD), 51 abridged somatization syndrome (SSI-8) and 67 other defined SFD. A 
      clinical non-SFD comparison group consisted of 123 patients. Treatment effects were 
      controlled against the waiting list. Cost calculations for the 2-year periods before 
      and after treatment were based on medical and billing records from health insurance 
      companies. RESULTS: The SFD patients improved significantly with respect to physical 
      symptom distress, health anxieties, dysfunctional beliefs towards body and health, 
      depression and psychosocial functioning. Their outpatient plus inpatient charges 
      during the 2 years prior to treatment were about 2.2-fold higher than for average 
      patients of the health system. At the 2-year follow-up, we found treatment-related 
      cost offset of 382 (-24.5%) for outpatient and 1098 (-36.7%) for inpatient care. 
      Indirect socioeconomic costs due to days lost from work decreased by 6702 (-35.3%). 
      Per patient savings of 32,174 (-63.9%) were found in a subgroup of somatizing 
      high-utilizers. CONCLUSION: The results encourage including treatment strategies to 
      reduce somatoform illness behavior into clinical practice.

TI  - Identifying factors influencing decision making in patients diagnosed with Carotid 
      Body Tumors; An exploratory study.
LID - S0890-5096(20)30451-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.avsg.2020.05.044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carotid Body Tumors (CBTs) are rare highly vascularized and slow 
      enlarging tumors arising from paraganglionic tissue at the carotid bifurcation(1). 
      Main treatment options for CBTs are surgical resection or 'wait and scan' strategy. 
      The choice for either strategy may be equally good medically in many patients. A 
      structured 'Shared Decision Making' (SDM) might be helpful for guiding patients. 
      AIM: In order to develop a SDM strategy for the surgical treatment we aim to: 1) 
      identify considerations and factors involved in the decision-making of patients with 
      CBTs; 2) evaluating the current practice in our clinic and explore the opinions of 
      patients on their treatment. METHODS: This exploratory study was conducted in 
      patients of the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), The Netherlands. Patients 
      who met the inclusion criteria were invited for a semi-structured interview. All 
      conversations were fully audiotaped and transcripted. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were 
      included and interviewed. Ten of these patients underwent previously surgical 
      resection of at least one tumor. Five patients underwent the wait and scan policy. 
      The most important factors influencing decision making in CBT treatment are; family, 
      fears, co-consultants and doctor-patient relationship. CONCLUSION: This study has 
      identified the factors influencing decision-making in CBT and should be considered 
      during consultations. The decision for surgery or not was mainly influenced by 
      physician preferences and family members' prior experiences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To illustrate a multidisciplinary group treatment for patients with 
      fibromyalgia (FM) tailored to the patient's cognitive-behavioral pattern. METHOD: In 
      a case-study design the tailored treatment approaches of two FM patients were 
      described. One patient characterized by avoidance behavior (pain-avoidance pattern) 
      participated in a group treatment aimed at changing pain-avoidance mechanisms and 
      one patient characterized by continuing with activities in spite of pain 
      (pain-persistence pattern) participated in a group treatment aimed at changing 
      pain-persistence mechanisms. Assessments were made at baseline, post-treatment and 
      at 6-months follow-up. RESULTS: Comparison of the pretest, post-test and follow-up 
      scores on pain, functional disability, fatigue and psychological distress showed 
      clinically significant improvements for both patients. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity 
      of patients regarding pain-related cognitive-behavioral mechanisms has been proposed 
      to underlie varying treatment outcomes in FM patients. These results demonstrate 
      that a group treatment tailored to pain-avoidance and pain-persistence patterns is 
      feasible and can result in clinically significant changes for FM patients. PRACTICE 
      IMPLICATIONS: FM offers a great challenge for clinicians due to the lack of 
      effective treatment options. These case studies suggests that tailored CBT and 
      exercise training directed at specific patient patterns can contribute to the 
      improvement of the care of FM patients.

AB  - A treatment outcome study was conducted to compare the efficacy of cognitive 
      behavior therapy (CBT) versus general anesthesia in alleviating the distress of 18 
      pediatric cancer patients (ages: 3-12 years) undergoing bone marrow aspirations 
      (BMAs). CBT and short-acting mask anesthesia were delivered within a 
      repeated-measures counterbalance design. Results indicated that children exhibited 
      more behavioral distress in the CBT condition for the 1st minute lying down on the 
      treatment table. However, parents rated significantly more behavioral adjustment 
      symptoms 24 h following the BMA when their children had received anesthesia. No 
      differences were found in childrens' and parents' preference for CBT versus 
      anesthesia.

TI  - Working alliance for clients with social anxiety disorder: relationship with session 
      helpfulness and within-session habituation.
PG  - 34-42
AB  - It has been suggested that a strong working alliance encourages clients to take 
      risks during therapy (Raue, Castonguay, & Goldfried, 1993). This encouragement may 
      be important for clients who fear negative evaluations as they engage in risk-taking 
      elements of therapy. This study examined the relationship between working alliance, 
      session helpfulness and measures of emotional processing in 18 clients undergoing 
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder. Results indicate a 
      positive correlation between client-rated, but not observer-rated, working alliance 
      and session helpfulness. Moderate levels of working alliance were associated with 
      higher initial anxiety and deeper within-session habituation. Overall, a strong 
      alliance was associated with clients engaging with the session and finding the 
      session helpful. Implications for the use of CBT for social anxiety are discussed.

TI  - Imagery rescripting and reprocessing therapy after failed prolonged exposure for 
      post-traumatic stress disorder following industrial injury.
PG  - 317-28
AB  - Prolonged exposure (PE) has been reported to be effective for improving 
      post-traumatic stress symptoms in 60-65% of trauma victims suffering from 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study examined the results of adding an 
      imagery-based, cognitive restructuring component (imagery rescripting and 
      reprocessing therapy, IRRT) to the treatment of 23 Type I trauma victims suffering 
      from PTSD, all of whom failed to improve with PE alone. With the added treatment 
      component, 18 of 23 clients showed a full recovery from their PTSD symptoms, and no 
      longer met criteria for PTSD after 1-3 sessions of IRRT. It was noteworthy that 
      non-FEAR emotions (e.g., guilt, shame, anger) were found to be predominant for all 
      23 PE failures examined in this study, suggesting that a simple habituation model 
      (on which PE is based) is not sufficient to address non-FEAR emotions in PTSD. By 
      contrast, IRRT, a cognitive restructuring treatment, was much more effective in PTSD 
      symptom reduction for these clients. It was proposed that more detailed, 
      individualized trauma assessments be conducted for each patient that focus on (1) 
      identifying the predominant trauma-related emotions and cognitions that maintain the 
      PTSD response, and (2) finding the best CBT "treatment fit" for the specific trauma 
      characteristics of each patient.

TI  - Alliance-focused therapy for anorexia nervosa: integrative relational and behavioral 
      change treatments in a single-case experimental design.
PG  - 401-420
LID - 10.1037/a0026216 [doi]
AB  - Evidence supporting outpatient treatments for anorexia nervosa (AN) is severely 
      lacking, due to low retention and poor outcome. One explanation for drop-out is weak 
      treatment alliances. A single-case experimental analysis accompanied by in-depth 
      qualitative description is presented for Ms. O, who received a novel treatment for 
      AN called Alliance Focused Treatment (AFT) that attends to ruptures in the alliance, 
      interpersonal difficulties and emotional avoidance. At intake Ms. O met diagnostic 
      criteria for AN, Major Depressive Disorder, and Social Phobia. She was characterized 
      as having symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive, Avoidant, and Depressive personality 
      disorders. Treatment began with a Baseline followed by the experimental (AFT) and 
      comparison treatments (Behavioral Change Treatment [BCT]) using a replicated 
      experimental single-case phase change design. Graphs of slopes of kilocalorie and 
      alliance change facilitated observation of treatment effects. Ms. O participated in 
      16 sessions of AFT and 8 sessions of BCT with specific benefits. Ratings of the 
      treatment alliance were consistently high and she evidenced significant changes in 
      weight, quality of life, and personality pathology. Associations between 
      rupture/repair episodes and kilocalorie increases were observed. The utility of the 
      treatment relationship in facilitating emotional expression was evident. At 
      posttreatment, Ms. O endorsed cognitive AN symptoms, although these were not 
      explicitly treated. This study provides preliminary support for the feasibility and 
      effect of AFT and BCT, and highlights the importance of the alliance in treating 
      adults with AN. Further research on emotion regulation in AN and its effect on the 
      treatment relationship are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For armed forces personnel, data on help-seeking behaviour and receipt 
      of treatment for mental disorders are important for both research and policy. AIMS: 
      To examine mental healthcare service use and receipt of treatment in a sample of the 
      UK military. METHOD: Participants were drawn from an existing UK military health 
      cohort. The sample was stratified by reserve status and by participation in the main 
      war-fighting period of the Iraq War. Participants completed a telephone-based 
      structured diagnostic interview comprising the Patient Health Questionnaire and 
      Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Screen (PC-PTSD), and a series of 
      questions about service utilisation and treatment receipt. RESULTS: Only 23% of 
      those with common mental disorders and still serving in the military were receiving 
      any form of medical professional help. Non-medical sources of help such as chaplains 
      were more widely used. Among regular personnel in receipt of professional help, most 
      were seen in primary care (79%) and the most common treatment was medication or 
      counselling/psychotherapy. Few regular personnel were receiving 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). These findings are comparable with those 
      reported for the general population. CONCLUSIONS: In the UK armed forces, the 
      majority of those with mental disorders are not currently seeking medical help for 
      their symptoms. Further work to understand barriers to care is important and timely 
      given that this is a group at risk of occupational psychiatric injury.

TI  - Bridging the gap between complexity science and clinical practice by formalizing 
      idiographic theories: a computational model of functional analysis.
PG  - 99
LID - 10.1186/s12916-020-01558-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The past decades of research have seen an increase in statistical tools 
      to explore the complex dynamics of mental health from patient data, yet the 
      application of these tools in clinical practice remains uncommon. This is 
      surprising, given that clinical reasoning, e.g., case conceptualizations, largely 
      coincides with the dynamical system approach. We argue that the gap between 
      statistical tools and clinical practice can partly be explained by the fact that 
      current estimation techniques disregard theoretical and practical considerations 
      relevant to psychotherapy. To address this issue, we propose that case 
      conceptualizations should be formalized. We illustrate this approach by introducing 
      a computational model of functional analysis, a framework commonly used by 
      practitioners to formulate case conceptualizations and design patient-tailored 
      treatment. METHODS: We outline the general approach of formalizing idiographic 
      theories, drawing on the example of a functional analysis for a patient suffering 
      from panic disorder. We specified the system using a series of differential 
      equations and simulated different scenarios; first, we simulated data without 
      intervening in the system to examine the effects of avoidant coping on the 
      development of panic symptomatic. Second, we formalized two interventions commonly 
      used in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; exposure and cognitive reappraisal) and 
      subsequently simulated their effects on the system. RESULTS: The first simulation 
      showed that the specified system could recover several aspects of the phenomenon 
      (panic disorder), however, also showed some incongruency with the nature of panic 
      attacks (e.g., rapid decreases were not observed). The second simulation study 
      illustrated differential effects of CBT interventions for this patient. All tested 
      interventions could decrease panic levels in the system. CONCLUSIONS: Formalizing 
      idiographic theories is promising in bridging the gap between complexity science and 
      clinical practice and can help foster more rigorous scientific practices in 
      psychotherapy, through enhancing theory development. More precise case 
      conceptualizations could potentially improve intervention planning and treatment 
      outcomes. We discuss applications in psychotherapy and future directions, amongst 
      others barriers for systematic theory evaluation and extending the framework to 
      incorporate interactions between individual systems, relevant for modeling social 
      learning processes. With this report, we hope to stimulate future efforts in 
      formalizing clinical frameworks.

TI  - The Impact of Personality Pathology on Treatment Outcome in Late-life Panic 
      Disorder.
PG  - 164-174
LID - 10.1097/PRA.0000000000000472 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbid personality disorders are assumed to negatively interfere with 
      the treatment outcome of affective disorders. Data on late-life panic disorder 
      remain unknown. We examined the association of personality pathology and treatment 
      outcome related to age and treatment modality. METHODS: An observational study on 
      the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder with 
      agoraphobia among patients 18 to 74 years of age and randomized controlled 
      comparison of paroxetine and CBT in older patients (60 y of age or older) were 
      performed. The diagnosis of panic disorder was confirmed by the Anxiety Disorder 
      Interview Schedule-Revised (ADIS-IV) and personality features were assessed with the 
      Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire. The impact of personality features on either 
      agoraphobic cognitions (Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire) or avoidance behavior 
      (Mobility Inventory Avoidance Scale) was examined by multiple linear regression 
      analyses adjusted for sex, level of education, duration of illness, comorbid 
      psychopathology, and baseline severity. The interaction between personality and age 
      was examined among those treated with CBT (n=90); the interaction between 
      personality and treatment modality was examined among the older subgroup (n=34). 
      RESULTS: Cluster B personality pathology (evaluated on the basis of either 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised 
      (DSM-III-R) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
      Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria depending on the date of assessment) was 
      negatively associated with outcomes of CBT in both younger and older adults with 
      panic disorder and agoraphobia. Older adults with a higher number of features of any 
      personality pathology or cluster A pathology had worse treatment outcomes when 
      treated with paroxetine compared with CBT. CONCLUSIONS: Cluster B pathology had a 
      detrimental effect on CBT treatment outcome for panic disorder in both age groups. 
      In late-life panic disorder with comorbid personality pathology, CBT may be 
      preferred over treatment with paroxetine.

TI  - Synchronous change in subjective and physiological reactivity during flight as an 
      indicator of treatment outcome for aviophobia: A longitudinal study with 3-year 
      follow-up.

LID - S0005-7916(18)30103-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.12.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Emotion can be seen as the organizing process that 
      coordinates response systems to deal effectively with challenges and opportunities. 
      Synchronous change in subjective and physiological reactivity is regarded as an 
      indication of this organizing process. Synchrony is expected to increase with the 
      intensity of emotional stimuli. Conversely, adaptive emotional functioning could be 
      indicated by progressive synchrony upon increasing demands, and the magnitude of 
      synchrony could be an indication of progress during therapy. METHODS: We examined 
      whether synchronous change in subjective and physiological reactivity over repeated 
      exposures increased from watching a flight video through simulated flight to actual 
      flight, and whether the magnitude of synchronous change predicted favourable short- 
      and long-term treatment outcome within a group of 77 aviophobic participants during 
      CBT. RESULTS: Results did not show a relationship between the intensity of the 
      phobic stimuli and the magnitude of synchronous change in subjective and 
      physiological reactivity. Moreover, synchronous change across both response systems 
      did not predict treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS: By design this study had no control 
      group. Additional treatment or life events between end of treatment and 3-year 
      follow-up were not assessed. CONCLUSION: The results provide only weak support for 
      the functionalistic view that successful treatment of anxiety disorders is indicated 
      by synchronous change in reactivity across emotional response systems. The 
      relationship between these systems is likely to be affected by many intervening 
      variables including higher order cognitive processes.

TI  - The revised version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders 
      (SCARED-R): treatment sensitivity in an early intervention trial for childhood 
      anxiety disorders.
PG  - 323-36
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The revised version of the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related 
      Emotional Disorders (SCARED-R) is a recently developed self-report questionnaire for 
      measuring DSM-IV defined anxiety disorder symptoms in children. The current study 
      examined the treatment sensitivity of the SCARED-R. METHODS: Thirty-six children 
      (aged 8-13 years) who fulfilled the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, 
      separation anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia received either group or 
      individual cognitive-behavioural treatment. Children completed the SCARED-R and a 
      traditional measure of childhood anxiety, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for 
      Children (STAIC), at three points in time: (1) 6 months before treatment (i.e. 
      baseline), (2) pre-treatment, and (3) post-treatment. RESULTS: Results showed that 
      children's SCARED-R and STAIC scores did not change from baseline to pre-treatment, 
      but significantly declined from pre-treatment to post-treatment. An additional 
      finding of the present study was that group and individual CBT were equally 
      effective in reducing children's anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded 
      that the SCARED-R reliably taps treatment effects and thus should be regarded as a 
      useful self-report index of childhood anxiety in clinical and research settings. 
      Furthermore, the data support the notion that CBT should be generally regarded as an 
      efficacious intervention for anxiety disordered children.

TI  - No effect of CBT-based online self-help training to reduce fear of cancer 
      recurrence: First results of the CAREST multicenter randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 86-97
LID - 10.1002/pon.5233 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a common consequence of surviving 
      cancer; therefore, easily accessible self-help training could help many cancer 
      survivors deal with FCR at low costs. The CAncer REcurrence Self-help Training 
      (CAREST) trial evaluates the effectiveness of an online-tailored self-help training 
      on the basis of evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy principles in breast 
      cancer survivors. Also, possible predictors for benefitting from the online 
      self-help training were examined. METHODS: This multicenter randomized controlled 
      trial included 262 female breast cancer survivors, randomly assigned to either 
      online self-help training (n = 130) or care as usual (CAU; n = 132). Participants 
      completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1; after intervention), and 
      9 months (T2). The primary outcome was FCR (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory 
      Severity subscale). Both effectiveness and predictors were analyzed with latent 
      growth curve modeling (LGCM) according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: 
      LGCM showed no differences between the average latent slope in both groups (χ(2) (1) 
       = .23, P = .63), suggesting that the treatments did not differ in their change in 
      FCR over time. Moreover, no differences were found in the effects of the predictors 
      on the latent slope in both groups (χ(2) (1)  = .12, P = .73), suggesting that no 
      significant predictors were found for the effect of the intervention on FCR. 
      CONCLUSION: There was no effect of the CBT-based online self-help training "Less 
      fear after cancer" in the current study. Therefore, we recommend adding professional 
      support to online interventions for FCR.

TI  - A multicentred randomised controlled trial of a primary care-based cognitive 
      behavioural programme for low back pain. The Back Skills Training (BeST) trial.
PG  - 1-253, iii-iv
LID - 10.3310/hta14410 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness of active management (AM) in 
      general practice versus AM plus a group-based, professionally led cognitive 
      behavioural approach (CBA) for subacute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and to 
      measure the cost of each strategy over a period of 12 months and estimate 
      cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: Pragmatic multicentred randomised controlled trial with 
      investigator-blinded assessment of outcomes. SETTING: Fifty-six general practices 
      from seven English regions. PARTICIPANTS: People with subacute and chronic LBP who 
      were experiencing symptoms that were at least moderately troublesome. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Participants were randomised (in a ratio of 2:1) to receive either AM+CBA or AM 
      alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the Roland Morris Disability 
      Questionnaire (RMQ) and the Modified Von Korff Scale (MVK), which measure LBP and 
      disability. Secondary outcomes included mental and physical health-related quality 
      of life (Short Form 12-item health survey), health status, fear avoidance beliefs 
      and pain self-efficacy. Cost-utility of CBA was considered from both the UK NHS 
      perspective and a broader health-care perspective, including both NHS costs and 
      costs of privately purchased goods and services related to LBP. Quality-adjusted 
      life-years (QALYs) were calculated from the five-item EuroQoL. RESULTS: Between 
      April 2005 and April 2007, 701 participants were randomised: 233 to AM and 468 to 
      AM+CBA. Of these, 420 were female. The mean age of participants was 54 years and 
      mean baseline RMQ was 8.7. Outcome data were obtained for 85% of participants at 12 
      months. Benefits were seen across a range of outcome measures in favour of CBA with 
      no evidence of group or therapist effects. CBA resulted in at least twice as much 
      improvement as AM. Mean additional improvement in the CBA arm was 1.1 [95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.4 to 1.7], 1.4 (95% CI 0.7 to 2.1) and 1.3 (95% CI 0.6 to 
      2.1) change points in the RMQ at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. Additional 
      improvement in MVK pain was 6.8 (95% CI 3.5 to 10.2), 8.0 (95% CI 4.3 to 11.7) and 
      7.0 (95% CI 3.2 to 10.7) points, and in MVK disability was 4.3 (95% CI 0.4 to 8.2), 
      8.1 (95% CI 4.1 to 12.0) and 8.4 (95% CI 4.4 to 12.4) points at 3, 6 and 12 months 
      respectively. At 12 months, 60% of the AM+CBA arm and 31% of the AM arm reported 
      some or complete recovery. Mean cost of attending a CBA course was 187 pounds per 
      participant with an additional benefit in QALYs of 0.099 and an additional cost of 
      178.06 pounds. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 1786.00 pounds. Probability 
      of CBA being cost-effective reached 90% at about 3000 pounds and remained at that 
      level or above; at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pounds the CBA group had 
      an almost 100% probability of being considered cost-effective. User perspectives on 
      the acceptability of group treatments were sought through semi-structured 
      interviews. Most were familiar with key messages of AM; most who had attended any 
      group sessions had retained key messages from the sessions and two-thirds talked 
      about a reduction in fear avoidance and changes in their behaviour. Group sessions 
      appeared to provide reassurance, lessen isolation and enable participants to learn 
      strategies from each other. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term effectiveness and 
      cost-effectiveness of CBA in treating subacute and chronic LBP was shown, making 
      this intervention attractive to patients, clinicians and purchasers. Short-term 
      (3-month) clinical effects were similar to those found in high-quality studies of 
      other therapies and benefits were maintained and increased over the long term (12 
      months). Cost per QALY was about half that of competing interventions for LBP and 
      because the intervention can be delivered by existing NHS staff following brief 
      training, the back skills training programme could be implemented within the NHS 
      with relative ease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN37807450.

AB  - Claustrophobia, this fear of being locked up without being able to escape, affects 
      about 4 to 5% of subjects in the general population. For some years, studies tackle 
      this trouble in the context of medical exam and treatments (MRI, radiotherapy, 
      etc.). Studies show that cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) obtain satisfying 
      results for treating such patients. Here, we present a case report of a CBT 
      intervention for a patient suffering from a cancer and whose claustrophobia impeded 
      her treatment.

TI  - Facing fears and sadness: cognitive-behavioral therapy for childhood traumatic 
      grief.
PG  - 187-98
AB  - The term childhood traumatic grief (CTG) is being increasingly used to refer to the 
      particular reaction in children that may follow the death of a loved one during a 
      traumatic event. The goal of this case study is to describe the theoretical argument 
      and framework for, as well as a clinical example of, cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) for CTG. We present a case of a five-year-old boy whose father, a firefighter, 
      died in the line of duty at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. This 
      specific case will highlight the steps of CBT for CTG, the value of assessment 
      during the therapeutic process, and the need to consider developmental and family 
      factors in treatment.

TI  - Cognitive change following cognitive behavioural therapy for non-cardiac chest pain.
PG  - 214-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seventeen to 43% of patients with non-cardiac chest pain suffer from 
      anxiety/panic disorders. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in 
      reducing non-cardiac chest pain. However, no data are available indicating that pain 
      reduction following CBT may be cognitively mediated or whether success of CBT is 
      dependent on the presence of panic. The aim of the study was threefold: (1) does CBT 
      have a differential effect on cognitive measures; (2) does a relationship exist 
      between improvement in non-cardiac chest pain and changes in cognitive measures, and 
      (3) can panic be established as a moderator of the effect of treatment? METHODS: 
      Sixty-five patients with non-cardiac chest pain completed a randomised trial 
      comparing study CBT with 'care as usual'. Dependent measures were: frequency of 
      chest pain, anxiety, the fear of bodily sensations, attributions and catastrophic 
      cognitions. RESULTS: CBT had a differential effect on most of the cognitive 
      measures. Pain reduction was associated with the development of more adequate 
      cognitions with respect to chest pain, independent of anxiety reduction. Although 
      panic patients reported higher baseline scores on the cognitive measures, no 
      differences in treatment results were found between panic and no-panic patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Pain reduction following CBT may be cognitively mediated. The presence 
      of panic did not affect the outcome of treatment, implying a broad applicability of 
      the cognitive model for treatment of patients with non-cardiac chest pain.

TI  - [Summary of the practice guideline 'Anxiety disorders' (first revision) from the 
      Dutch College of General Practitioners].
PG  - 1211-5
AB  - Anxiety disorders are characterised by excessive fears leading to distress or social 
      disability. Anxiety disorders are difficult to recognise. General practitioners 
      (GPs) should consider the possibility more often, especially in patients who make 
      frequent visits with unexplained physical symptoms. The cornerstone of treatment is 
      patient education, which can be supported by information leaflets provided by the 
      Dutch College of General Practitioners. Cognitive behavioural therapy and 
      antidepressants are equally effective therapies in most anxiety disorders. The 
      choice should be made in collaboration with the patient. Pharmacological treatment 
      is the first choice when a comorbid depression is involved. Cognitive behavioural 
      therapy by the GP is optional considering the limitations of skills and time in 
      general practice. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin re-uptake 
      inhibitors are equally effective with most anxiety disorders. The choice must be 
      made on the basis of side effects, comorbidity, and co-medication. Antidepressant 
      therapy should be given for at least 6-12 months. The GP's choice oftreatment should 
      lead to improvement within 8-12 weeks. Otherwise, consultation of or referral to a 
      specialist in mental health care is mandatory.

      social anxiety disorder: Preliminary report.
PG  - 6-10
LID - 10.1016/j.jbtep.2009.08.005 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to examine how video feedback can affect perceived 
      performance and anticipatory anxiety in various naturalistic social 
      anxiety-provoking situations among clinical patients diagnosed with social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD) and to examine predictors that might influence response to video 
      feedback. Participants were 52 consecutive patients with DSM-IV SAD who participated 
      in a group-based CBT program. Our results demonstrated that video feedback was 
      associated with a decrease in the underestimation of own performance as well as the 
      perception of feared outcomes. Moreover, anticipatory anxiety decreased after video 
      feedback combined with peer feedback. Male sex, comorbidity with other anxiety 
      disorders, and benzodiazepine prn, as well as patients' initial anxiety and 
      avoidance were negative predictors of the effect of video feedback.

PG  - 777-81
AB  - Historical myths about inevitable behavioural and cognitive consequences of 
      epileptic disorders still provide patients and their families with unfounded fears 
      leading to self-fulfilling prophecies of psychosocial and mental deterioration. 
      Psychomotor attacks are subjectively experienced disruptions in the continuity of 
      life and self-perception which it will be difficult to integrate into the 
      organization of daily life. These facts must be kept in mind when epileptic patients 
      present psychological problems. The most common features of neuropsychological and 
      psychosocial problems are discussed and the importance of combining optimal 
      antiepileptic medication with psychotherapy is underlined. Coexisting epileptic and 
      psychogenic symptoms being difficult to disentangle patients presenting both may be 
      exposed to unfortunate alternating therapeutic strategies by ambitendent therapists. 
      Careful observation without overt attention combined with assisting the patient in 
      obtaining more autonomy and self management appear to be the best policy to stop 
      psychogenic fits.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anxiety disorders in primary school-aged children negatively affect 
      their mental health and psychological development. Available non-medical treatments 
      for these conditions are time-consuming and expensive. In this context, eclectic 
      therapy is a therapeutic approach that incorporates some therapeutic techniques and 
      philosophies to create the ideal treatment. In this study, eclectic therapy 
      consisted of art therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy designed for children 
      suffering from high level of anxiety in their middle childhood years. The therapy 
      also included group guidance sessions for their mothers. The effectiveness of this 
      intervention was examined in the study. METHODS: 61 students aged 9-12 years with 
      high levels of anxiety participated in the study. Intervention A (n = 20) consisted 
      of 9-hour eclectic therapy for children with 3-hour group guidance sessions for 
      their mothers. Intervention B (n = 20) consisted of 9-hour eclectic therapy for 
      children. There was also a control group (n = 21). RESULTS: Teacher ratings of 
      children's mental health difficulties and self-report ratings of anxiety disorders 
      indicated a significant difference from pretest to posttest, revealing a large 
      effect size between the two interventions. Higher levels of pretest scores 
      significantly predicted higher posttest scores for all domains of anxiety and mental 
      health difficulties. Furthermore, age, gender, mothers working a 15-hour day, 
      mother's educational level, parental divorce rates, parental death, and family 
      monthly income predicted therapy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Results provide support for 
      the effectiveness of eclectic art and CBT to improve children's mental health and 
      reduce anxiety through changing thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and behaviors that may 
      cause fear and anxiety.

TI  - Automated psychological therapy using virtual reality (VR) for patients with 
      persecutory delusions: study protocol for a single-blind parallel-group randomised 
      controlled trial (THRIVE).
PG  - 87
LID - 10.1186/s13063-019-3198-6 [doi]
LID - 87
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persecutory delusions are a major psychiatric problem and are associated 
      with a wide range of adverse outcomes. Our theoretical model views these delusions 
      as unfounded threat beliefs which persist due to defence behaviours (e.g. avoidance) 
      that prevent disconfirmatory evidence being processed. The treatment implications 
      are that patients need to (1) go into feared situations and (2) not use defence 
      behaviours. This enables relearning of safety and hence paranoia diminution. 
      However, this is very difficult for patients due to their severe anxiety. A solution 
      is to use virtual reality (VR) social situations, which are graded in difficulty and 
      which patients find much easier to enter. We have now automated the provision of 
      cognitive therapy within VR using an avatar coach, so that a therapist is not 
      required and the treatment is scalable. In the THRIVE trial, the automated VR 
      cognitive treatment will be tested against a VR control condition. It will 
      contribute to our wider programme of work developing VR for patients with psychosis. 
      METHODS: Patients with persistent persecutory delusions in the context of 
      non-affective psychosis will be randomised (1:1) to the automated VR cognitive 
      treatment or VR mental relaxation (control condition). Each VR treatment will 
      comprise approximately four sessions of 30 min. Standard care will remain as usual 
      in both groups. Assessments will be carried out at 0, 2, 4 (post treatment), 8, 16, 
      and 24 weeks by a researcher blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is 
      degree of conviction in the persecutory delusion (primary endpoint 4 weeks). Effect 
      sizes will be re-established by an interim analysis of 30 patients. If the interim 
      effect size suggests that the treatment is worth pursuing (d > 0.1), then the trial 
      will go on to test 90 patients in total. Secondary outcomes include real world 
      distress, activity levels, suicidal ideation, and quality of life. Mediation will 
      also be tested. All main analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. The 
      trial is funded by the Medical Research Council Developmental Pathway Funding 
      Scheme. DISCUSSION: The trial will provide the first test of automated cognitive 
      therapy within VR for patients with psychosis. The treatment is potentially highly 
      scalable for treatment services. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12497310 .

TI  - Reduction of fear and anxiety in adult fearful patients.
PG  - 127-36
AB  - Dental fear is most often of multifactorial origin and is most successfully treated 
      by behavioural therapies. The need for specialized treatments is related to the 
      severity of the fear reaction and its consequences. For the majority of anxious 
      patients simple treatment techniques readily available and applicable in general 
      practice should be used. These procedures aim to restructure the patient's 
      anticipation and evaluation of the dental situation. However, the establishment of 
      specialized research and treatment centres has resulted in improved understanding 
      and knowledge of the severely phobic patients with long-standing avoidance symptoms. 
      These individuals suffer from more disseminated effects of dental fear and benefit 
      most from broadly based therapies that use both cognitive-behavioural and 
      psychophysiological components. There may also be indications for the use of 
      pharmacological therapies. The immediate posttherapy successful outcome rates are at 
      levels of 70 to 80 per cent for broadly based therapies or combinations of treatment 
      modalities. In spite of an obvious shortage of follow-up investigations, Swedish 
      studies on severely phobic and avoiding groups have revealed that similar outcome 
      figures may be valid over longer periods of time. The Swedish studies also indicate 
      beneficial side-effects on the patients' general well-being and psychosocial 
      situation.

      extinction to identify novel treatments for anxiety disorders.

AB  - The burden of anxiety disorders is growing, but the efficacy of available anxiolytic 
      treatments remains inadequate. Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders 
      focuses on identifying and modifying maladaptive patterns of thinking and behaving, 
      and has a testable analogue in rodents in the form of fear extinction. A large 
      preclinical literature has amassed in recent years describing the neural and 
      molecular basis of fear extinction in rodents. In this review, we discuss how this 
      work is being harnessed to foster translational research on anxiety disorders and 
      facilitate the search for new anxiolytic treatments. We begin by summarizing the 
      anatomical and functional connectivity of a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-amygdala 
      circuit that subserves fear extinction, including new insights from optogenetics. We 
      then cover some of the approaches that have been taken to model impaired fear 
      extinction and associated impairments with mPFC-amygdala dysfunction. The principal 
      goal of the review is to evaluate evidence that various neurotransmitter and 
      neuromodulator systems mediate fear extinction by modulating the mPFC-amygdala 
      circuitry. To that end, we describe studies that have tested how fear extinction is 
      impaired or facilitated by pharmacological manipulations of dopamine, noradrenaline, 
      5-HT, GABA, glutamate, neuropeptides, endocannabinoids and various other systems, 
      which either directly target the mPFC-amygdala circuit, or produce behavioural 
      effects that are coincident with functional changes in the circuit. We conclude that 
      there are good grounds to be optimistic that the progress in defining the molecular 
      substrates of mPFC-amygdala circuit function can be effectively leveraged to 
      identify plausible candidates for extinction-promoting therapies for anxiety 
      disorders.

AB  - Reliable behavioural tests in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases allow us 
      to study the natural history of disease and evaluate the efficacy of novel 
      therapies. Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA (MPS IIIA or Sanfilippo A), is a severe, 
      neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the heparan 
      sulphate catabolising enzyme, sulfamidase. Undegraded heparan sulphate accumulates, 
      resulting in lysosomal enlargement and cellular dysfunction. Patients suffer a 
      progressive loss of motor and cognitive function with severe behavioural 
      manifestations and premature death. There is currently no treatment. A spontaneously 
      occurring mouse model of the disease has been described, that has approximately 3% 
      of normal enzyme activity levels. Behavioural phenotyping of the MPS IIIA mouse has 
      been previously reported, but the results are conflicting and variable, even after 
      full backcrossing to the C57BL/6 background. Therefore we have independently 
      backcrossed the MPS IIIA model onto the C57BL/6J background and evaluated the 
      behaviour of male and female MPS IIIA mice at 4, 6 and 8 months of age using the 
      open field test, elevated plus maze, inverted screen and horizontal bar crossing at 
      the same circadian time point. Using a 60 minute open field, we have demonstrated 
      that female MPS IIIA mice are hyperactive, have a longer path length, display rapid 
      exploratory behaviour and spend less time immobile than WT mice. Female MPS IIIA 
      mice also display a reduced sense of danger and spend more time in the centre of the 
      open field. There were no significant differences found between male WT and MPS IIIA 
      mice and no differences in neuromuscular strength were seen with either sex. The 
      altered natural history of behaviour that we observe in the MPS IIIA mouse will 
      allow more accurate evaluation of novel therapeutics for MPS IIIA and potentially 
      other neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tranylcypromine has been recommend as an option for therapy-resistant 
      depressive and anxiety disorders. In this case report the effectiveness of this 
      medication as a part of a combined therapy-program including pharmacological, 
      behavioural and psychodynamic interventions could be demonstrated on an outpatient 
      with a therapy-resistant depression and agoraphobia. METHODS: The development of the 
      illness, clinical symptoms and the 4 year ongoing therapy of a 69-year old patient 
      are described in detail. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: After the failure of 13 antidepressant 
      agents with considerable side effects, a one year sustained remission of depression 
      as well as great improvement of agoraphobia could be achieved with tranylcypromine. 
      In this situation, tranylcypromine showed itself, for the first time, to be a very 
      effective and well tolerated antidepressant.

TI  - Efficacy of rehabilitative therapy in regional musculoskeletal conditions.
PG  - 151-66
AB  - This chapter reviews the best evidence for the rehabilitation of regional 
      musculoskeletal conditions. Evidence-based efficacy of different modalities for 
      treatment of musculoskeletal pain is presented, and the value of the patient's 
      active participation in the rehabilitation programme is emphasized. The following 
      modalities are commonly included in the holistic approach to patient-centred care 
      and are reviewed: exercise therapy, thermotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve 
      stimulation (TENS), and alternative therapies such as acupuncture, massage and yoga. 
      A review of cognitive-behavioural strategies in pain management to prevent or treat 
      fear-avoidance behaviour is also presented. Furthermore, the application of 
      biomechanics in treating and preventing musculoskeletal disorders is illustrated. 
      Moreover, the evidence for pain self-management to improve symptoms, health status 
      and decrease the utilization of health care resources and cost is outlined. Finally, 
      an overview will be presented, concerning the application of the evidence for 
      treatment modalities to patient care, with focus on patient-centred, holistic 
      treatment in a supportive setting. The following key questions/issues are addressed. 
      What are the relevant therapeutic modalities for musculoskeletal pain disorders? 
      What is the evidence of efficacy of these modalities in regional musculoskeletal 
      conditions? What is the importance of understanding biomechanics? What is the 
      importance of understanding fear-avoidance beliefs? What is the evidence for 
      'alternative' therapies such as acupuncture, massage or yoga? What is the evidence 
      for 'pain self-management?' How does one apply the evidence for rehabilitation in 
      regional musculoskeletal conditions into clinical practice?

TI  - Evaluation of a randomized preventive behavioural medicine work site intervention 
      for public health workers at risk for developing chronic pain.
PG  - 421-32
AB  - Because of the substantial increase of sick listing, reports of work disabilities 
      and early retirement due to the musculoskeletal chronic pain, prevention studies at 
      the work site are greatly needed. The purpose of the present study was to 
      investigate the effects of a cognitive behavioural work site intervention on a group 
      of public health workers judged to be at risk for developing chronic pain. Following 
      baseline measurements, a group of 29 practical nurses with daily pain symptoms 
      working at services for the elderly were randomized into two conditions: an active 
      treatment based on cognitive behaviour therapy and a passive treatment based on 
      traditional symptom alleviation. The two treatment conditions, provided by a 
      registered nurse and a physical therapist, took place 30 min a week each once a 
      week, on an individual basis for 4 weeks at the work site during work time. Results 
      at 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 24 month follow-ups showed improvements for those 
      individuals receiving the active treatment with regard to the reduction of use of 
      pain-killers, perception of one's self as being sick and the fear-avoidance response 
      to work-related activities. A preliminary conclusion was that this short-term work 
      site programme for the prevention of chronic pain for individuals at risk may be a 
      promising development in the treatment of pain.

AB  - Recommendations suggest a multicomponent exercise for people with osteoporosis. We 
      identified rehabilitation professionals' barriers and facilitators to implementing 
      exercise recommendations with people with osteoporosis, and used those to make 
      suggestions for targeted knowledge translation interventions. Future work will 
      report on development and evaluation of the interventions informed by our study. 
      PURPOSE: Rehabilitation professionals can help people with osteoporosis to engage in 
      a multicomponent exercise program and perform activities of daily living safely. 
      However, rehabilitation professional face barriers to implementing exercise 
      evidence, especially for specific disease conditions like osteoporosis. We performed 
      a behavioural analysis and identified rehabilitation professionals' barriers to and 
      facilitators of implementing disease-specific physical activity and exercise 
      recommendations (Too Fit to Fracture recommendations), and used the Behaviour Change 
      Wheel to select interventions. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups 
      were conducted with rehabilitation professionals, including physical therapists, 
      kinesiologists, and occupational therapists, and transcribed verbatim. Two 
      researchers coded data and identified emerging themes. Using the Behaviour Change 
      Wheel framework, themes were categorized into capability, opportunity, and 
      motivation, and relevant interventions were identified. RESULTS: Ninety-four 
      rehabilitation professionals (mean age 40.5 years, 88.3% female) participated. 
      Identified barriers were as follows: capability-lack of training in behaviour 
      change, how to modify recommendations for physical and cognitive impairments; 
      opportunity-lack of resources, time, and team work; motivation-lack of trust between 
      providers, fear in providing interventions that may cause harm. Interventions 
      selected were as follows: education, training, enablement, modelling and persuasion. 
      Policy categories are communication/marketing, guidelines, service provision and 
      environmental/social planning. CONCLUSIONS: Key barriers to implementing the 
      recommendations are rehabilitation professionals' ability to use behaviour change 
      techniques, to modify the recommendations for physical and cognitive limitations and 
      to feel comfortable with delivering challenging but safe interventions for people 
      with osteoporosis, and lacking trust and team work across sectors. Future work will 
      report on development and evaluation of knowledge translation interventions informed 
      by our study.

AB  - Background and aims There is very little published evaluation of the treatment of 
      military veterans with chronic pain, with or without post-traumatic stress disorder. 
      Few clinical services offer integrated treatment for veterans with chronic pain and 
      PTSD. Such veterans experience difficulty in accessing treatment for either 
      condition: services may consider each condition as a contraindication to treatment 
      of the other. Veterans are therefore often passed from one specialist service to 
      another without adequate treatment. The veteran pain management programme (PMP) in 
      the UK was established to meet the needs of veterans suffering from chronic pain 
      with or without PTSD; this is the first evaluation. Methods The PMP was advertised 
      online via veteran charities. Veterans self-referred with accompanying information 
      from General Practitioners. Veterans were then invited for an inter-disciplinary 
      assessment and if appropriate invited onto the next PMP. Exclusion criteria 
      included; current severe PTSD, severe depression with active suicidal ideation, 
      moderate to severe personality disorder, or who were unable to self-care in the 
      accommodation available. Treatment was by a team of experienced pain management 
      clinicians: clinical psychologist, physiotherapist, nurse, medical consultant and 
      psychiatrist. The PMP was delivered over 10 days: five residential days then five 
      single days over the subsequent 6 months. The PMP combines cognitive behavioural 
      treatment, which has the strongest evidence base, with more recent developments from 
      mindfulness-based CBT for pain and compassion-focused therapy. Standard pain 
      management strategies were adapted to meet the specific needs of the population, 
      recognising the tendency to use demanding activity to manage post-traumatic stress 
      symptoms. Domains of outcome were pain, mood, function, confidence and changes in 
      medication use. Results One hundred and sixty four military veterans started 
      treatment in 19 programmes, and 158 completed. Results from those with high and low 
      PTSD were compared; overall improvements in all domains were statistically 
      significant: mood, self-efficacy and confidence, and those with PTSD showed a 
      reduction (4.3/24 points on the IES-6). At the end of the programme the data showed 
      that 17% reduced opioid medication and 25% stopped all opioid use. Conclusions 
      Veterans made clinically and statistically significant improvements, including those 
      with co-existing PTSD, who also reduced their symptom level. This serves to 
      demonstrate the feasibility of treating veterans with both chronic pain and PTSD 
      using a PMP model of care. Implications Military veterans experiencing both chronic 
      pain and PTSD can be treated in a PMP adapted for their specific needs by an 
      experienced clinical team.

      fatigue.
PG  - 211-220
LID - 10.1111/sjop.12363 [doi]
AB  - Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has never been tested for patients with 
      chronic fatigue. We aimed to test if a 3.5-week ACT rehabilitation program for 
      patients with chronic fatigue improved quality of life (QoL), fatigue, and 
      psychological flexibility. Further, to test if improvements in QoL and fatigue were 
      associated with improvement in psychological flexibility, and if psychological 
      flexibility explained variance above and beyond maladaptive cognitions typically 
      targeted in CBT for fatigue. Patients (n = 140) who had been on sick leave > 8 weeks 
      due to chronic fatigue received a 3.5-week non-controlled inpatient rehabilitation 
      program based on ACT. A physician and a psychologist examined the patients, 
      assessing medication use and SCID-I diagnoses. Patients completed questionnaires 
      about somatic complaints, psychological complaints, and maladaptive cognitions 
      before and after treatment. At post-treatment, patients reported improved QoL (p < 
      0.001; g = 1.07) and less fatigue (p < 0.001; g = 1.08), but not increased 
      psychological flexibility (p = 0.6). Changes in psychological flexibility was 
      associated with improved QoL, but not fatigue, in hierarchical regression analyses. 
      When adjusting for other cognitions, changes in fear-avoidance cognitions and 
      all-or-nothing thoughts, but not psychological flexibility, were associated with 
      improved QoL and fatigue. The ACT-based treatment improved QoL and reduced fatigue 
      for patients with chronic fatigue with large effect sizes. Improvement was 
      associated with a reduction in fear-avoidance cognitions and all-or-nothing 
      thoughts, but not psychological flexibility.

TI  - New evidence for a pain personality? A critical review of the last 120 years of pain 
      and personality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Personality traits may influence development and adjustment to ongoing 
      pain. Over the past 120 years, there has been considerable research into the 
      relationship between pain and personality. This paper presents new evidence for 
      common personality traits found amongst chronic pain sufferers. In particular, it 
      evaluates evidence for Cloninger's biopsychosocial model of personality in 
      distinguishing typical personality features of chronic pain sufferers. It evaluates 
      this evidence in the context of the past 120 years of research including 
      psychodynamic formulations, MMPI studies, personality disorder investigations, and 
      the influence of neuroticism on chronic pain. METHODS: A literature search was 
      conducted using PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, SCOPUS and Cochrane library. Search terms 
      included chronic pain, pain, personality, neuroticism, harm avoidance, 
      self-directedness, attachment, Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-R), MMPI, 
      MMPI-2, NEO-PI, EPI, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, Millon Behavioral Health 
      Inventory, Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic, the Personality Assessment 
      Inventory, the Locus of Control Construct and different combinations of these terms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Recent descriptive studies using Cloninger's Temperament and Character 
      Inventory (TCI-R) suggest that higher harm avoidance and lower self-directedness may 
      be the most distinguishing personality features of chronic pain sufferers. High harm 
      avoidance refers to a tendency to be fearful, pessimistic, sensitive to criticism, 
      and requiring high levels of re-assurance. Low self-directedness often manifests as 
      difficulty with defining and setting meaningful goals, low motivation, and problems 
      with adaptive coping. Evidence for this personality profile is found across a wide 
      variety of chronic pain conditions including fibromyalgia, headache and migraine, 
      temporomandibular disorder, trigeminal neuropathy, musculo-skeletal disorders and 
      heterogeneous pain groups. Limitations are also discussed. For example, high harm 
      avoidance is also found in those suffering anxiety and depression. While many 
      studies control for such factors, some do not and thus future research should 
      address such confounds carefully. The evidence is also evaluated within the context 
      of past research into the existence of 'a pain personality'. Psychodynamic 
      formulations are found to be deficient in objective scientific methods. MMPI studies 
      lack sufficient evidence to support 'a pain personality' and may be confounded by 
      somatic items in the instrument. More recent neuroticism studies suggest a 
      relationship between neuroticism and pain, particularly for adjustment to chronic 
      pain. Personality disorders are more prevalent in chronic pain populations than 
      non-pain samples. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Because harm avoidance reflects a tendency 
      to developed conditioned fear responses, we suggest that higher harm avoidance may 
      create more vulnerability to developing a fear-avoidance response to chronic pain. 
      Furthermore, lower self-directedness may contribute to keeping a sufferer within 
      this vicious cycle of fear, avoidance and suffering. Moreover, we suggest that harm 
      avoidance and self-directedness are broader and more complex constructs than current 
      clinical targets of CBT such as fear-avoidance and self-efficacy. Thus, assessing 
      such personality traits may help to address the complexity of chronic pain 
      presentations. For example, it may help to identify and treat sufferers more 
      resistant to treatment, more prone to comorbidity and more vulnerable to entering 
      the vicious cycle of chronic pain, suffering and disability.

TI  - A critical review of the literature on fear of hypoglycemia in diabetes: 
      Implications for diabetes management and patient education.
PG  - 10-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In many individuals with diabetes, the unpleasant symptoms and negative 
      consequences associated with hypoglycemia may result in significant anxiety or even 
      a fear of hypoglycemia (FoH). This fear may have significant clinical implications 
      for diabetes management. The aim of this review is to integrate existing research on 
      FoH (its measurement, predictors, correlates, impact and treatment) and discuss its 
      implications for diabetes management and patient education. METHODS: A literature 
      search was conducted using Medline and Embase. The search was limited to journal 
      articles published in English from 1985 to 2007 inclusive. Three hundred and one 
      abstracts were reviewed and 273 were rejected on the basis of non-relevance. In 
      addition to the 28 papers included, six additional papers were identified by further 
      searches and were added to this review. RESULTS: FoH appears to be a widespread 
      phenomenon. It is measured primarily through the use of a specific scale, the 
      Hypoglycemic Fear Survey (HFS). There are a number of factors that relate to whether 
      an individual is likely to develop FoH including whether there is a history of 
      hypoglycemia in an individual, length of time since first insulin treatment, and a 
      higher level of variability in blood glucose level. FoH has been linked to both 
      state and trait anxiety although the relationship is complex. CONCLUSIONS: There is 
      evidence that FoH may have a significant negative impact on diabetes management, 
      metabolic control and subsequent health outcomes. There is evidence that blood 
      glucose (BG) awareness training and CBT can reduce levels of fear and improve 
      disease management. More research is needed on how FoH arises and the individual 
      variables which predict its development. In addition, well designed research is 
      required to better understand the behavioral and medical impact of FoH, and 
      interventions to reduce it. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: There is some evidence to suggest 
      that interventions including BG awareness training and cognitive behavioral therapy 
      can reduce levels of fear and improve disease management. While many aspects of FoH 
      require further well-designed research, it is evident that this phenomenon can have 
      a major impact on diabetes management and needs to be specifically addressed in 
      patient education programs.

TI  - Parental anxiety as a predictor of medication and CBT response for anxious youth.
PG  - 84-93
LID - 10.1007/s10578-014-0454-6 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to evaluate how parental anxiety predicted change 
      in pediatric anxiety symptoms across four different interventions: 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication (sertraline; SRT), their combination 
      (COMB), and pill placebo. Participants were 488 youths (ages 7-17) with separation 
      anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia and their 
      primary caregivers. Latent growth curve modeling assessed how pre-treatment parental 
      trait anxiety symptoms predicted trajectories of youth anxiety symptom change across 
      12 weeks of treatment at four time points. Interactions between parental anxiety and 
      treatment condition were tested. Parental anxiety was not associated with youth's 
      pre-treatment anxiety symptom severity. Controlling for parental trait anxiety, 
      youth depressive symptoms, and youth age, youths who received COMB benefitted most. 
      Counter to expectations, parental anxiety influenced youth anxiety symptom 
      trajectory only within the SRT condition, whereas parental anxiety was not 
      significantly associated with youth anxiety trajectories in the other treatment 
      conditions. Specifically, within the SRT condition, higher levels of parental 
      anxiety predicted a faster and greater reduction in youth anxiety over the acute 
      treatment period compared to youths in the SRT condition whose parents had lower 
      anxiety levels. While all active treatments produced favorable outcomes, results 
      provide insight regarding the treatment-specific influence of parental anxiety on 
      the time course of symptom change.

TI  - [Failure effects and gender differences in perfectionism].
PG  - 125-35
AB  - Perfectionism is a dimension which has been studied very little as a separate 
      entity. It is not even considered as a nosological factor. No classification of the 
      medical sciences underlines its importance other than to speak of a personality 
      trait, of an aspect, or of a parameter. Nevertheless, perfectionism is related to 
      multiple disorders such as depression (18, 20, 36), suicide (8, 16, 55), nutritional 
      problems (11, 28), anxiety (3), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (53), 
      social phobia (2), as well as insomnia (46). Certain authors stress the possible 
      role of perfectionism in the development or the persistence of a substantial number 
      of these disorders (7, 22, 38). Given these facts, it is all the easier to 
      understand the interest shown by clinicians and researchers in the subject. Better 
      detection and evaluation of its impact on behaviour is important in putting 
      therapies in place (6, 53). Relationships between perfectionism and fear of failure 
      have been approached (21, 51, 54). Correlations between perfectionism and high 
      levels of state and trait anxiety have been demonstrated (23). The evaluation of 
      perfectionism has been dealt with very little. Some questionnaires devote a 
      sub-category to it, such as the Eating Disorder Inventory and the Irrational Beliefs 
      Test. However, recently, it has been recognized that perfectionism is a 
      multidimensional construct. Two Multidimensional Perfectionism Scales have been 
      developed and investigated in relative isolation. Frost, Marten, Lahart and 
      Rosenblate defined perfectionism as the setting of excessively high standards for 
      performance associated with critical self-evaluation. Six dimensions are described: 
      concern over making mistakes, high personal standards, parental expectations, 
      parental criticism, doubt about quality of performance and organization. Internal 
      consistency and validity have been established (25, 26). Hewitt and Flett (30, 31, 
      33, 35) have developed another approach where three dimensions of perfectionism are 
      described: SOP (Self Oriented Perfectionism) related to high standards and self 
      criticism, SPP (Socially Prescribed Perfectionism) related to the need of approval 
      from others and fear of negative evaluation, OOP (Other-Oriented Perfectionism) 
      reflecting a tendency to set high expectations for others and to evaluate them in a 
      demanding way; this component is related, especially for males, to self-esteem, 
      hostility and authoritarianism. Validity and internal consistency have been 
      established too (30, 31, 35). The Frost and al's Multidimensional Perfectionism 
      Scale and the Hewitt and Flett's scales are closely associated, except concerning 
      the OOP. Because this component could provide new information, we have chosen the 
      second scale, referring to the French translation and validation of Labrecque (45). 
      EMP is the French name of MPS; it is a self-report questionnaire of 45 questions, in 
      fact three subscales of 15 items rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale. MPS was 
      administered to 617 first year students at the university of Liège (table II). 
      Differences are considered according to gender and experience of failure i.e. the 
      fact of repeating an academic year. We realized a component analysis with promax 
      rotation. Among the different possibilities offered by the scree-test the choice of 
      a 4 factor solution stresses the original structure: SOP (14 items), SPP (12 items), 
      OOP (9 items) and anti OOP (10 items); the last one is additional but allows for 
      respecting semantics and saturation of the items. The first aim of confirming 
      validity and internal consistency is satisfactory. In other respects the 
      multidimensional structure of the concept leads to consideration of a positive, 
      adaptive perfectionism and a more negative perfectionism, facilitating 
      psychopathology (59, 60, 61). So it seems interesting to compare the different 
      components of MPS in order to find an eventual sex-failure effect. The evaluation of 
      perfectionism is obvious, considering it as a personality trait, but it can be used 
      also in taking into account stress and its impact, for instance that of academic 
      performance (29, 37, 39, 58). Conferring on MPS more pertinence in gender 
      differentiation and failure evaluation is an other goal of this research. Through 
      the particular choice of statistical results, sex and sex-failure effects can be 
      demonstrated: a MANOVA underlines sex effect (lambda de Wilks = 0.96, p = 0.001) and 
      sex-failure effect (lambda de Wilks = 0.98, p = 0.05). Structure of MPS is different 
      in four groups (FE: women with failure, FnE: women without failure, ME: men with 
      failure, MnE: men without failure). ANOVA show differences of MPS3, MPS1 and MPS2. 
      Far more promising is the use of LISREL method allowing for the construction of a 
      coherent model of relationships between some dimensions of MPS and Test-Anxiety, 
      approached here with THEE (test d'habileté aux études et à leur évaluation) French 
      abbreviated version (49) of TASTE (Test for Ability to Study and Evaluation). In 
      fact according to the literature of fear of failure, girls score higher on anxiety 
      and procrastination but less on self-confidence. The structural model shows 
      different pathways, more especially between SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism), 
      T2 (sense of incompetence) and T1 (anxiety). SOP (self oriented perfectionism) and 
      SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism) by girls are very much correlated; it seems 
      that they are more subjected to society and its exigencies of studying but 
      consequently they are more at risk of anxiety and a sense of incompetence. SOP (self 
      oriented perfectionism) by boys functions more indiscriminately of SPP (socially 
      prescribed perfectionism) and is negatively correlated with self-incompetence; boys 
      are more self-confident but they usually procrastinate more probably because failure 
      expectancies would be particularly harmful for their self-esteem; consequently, 
      failure should be related to something else than their own capacity; this may be an 
      explanation of the high rate of male dropouts and failure in the first year at the 
      university of Liège; also a factor explaining the female domination at the 
      university. In the same way the first choice of studies is moving towards shorter 
      and less difficult orientation (46). In case of failure the model is very similar 
      according to gender: SOP (self oriented perfectionism) and T1 (anxiety) are directly 
      connected; SOP and SPP are in this case better correlated by boys but the path 
      between SPP, sense of incompetence and anxiety is less significant than in girls. In 
      conclusion, providing some modifications according to semantics, the choice of a 
      four factor solution allows for confirmation of the original structure of MPS and 
      for internal consistency. The different components of MPS vary according to gender: 
      SOP and more OOP discriminate men and women; SPP allows for differentiating women 
      with failure. A structural model enhances the role of perfectionism in the cognitive 
      and behavioural contexts; for instance it clarifies its action on fear of failure 
      and success rates according to gender.

AB  - Anxiety disorders may be encountered by the medical practitioner in the form of 
      phobias, panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. A phobia is characterized 
      by a strong, irrational fear of a given object or situation, often resulting in 
      avoidance behavior. Phobic patients usually respond well to cognitive behavioral 
      therapy. Panic disorder, which is distinguished by recurring, unexpected attacks of 
      fear not bound to particular situations, may also be treated with cognitive 
      behavioral therapy and/or with clomipramin, benzodiazepines or selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder, the main symptom of 
      which is a persistent, free-floating fear over a period of at least several months, 
      may be helped through relaxation techniques, counseling and/or medication with low 
      doses of sedating tricyclic compounds or short-term treatment with benzodiazepines. 
      This article will describe anamnestic findings and the results of clinical 
      examinations of patients with anxiety disorders. Factors to be considered in 
      differential diagnosis will be discussed.

AB  - Anxiety disorders affect 16 percent of the U.S. population. Family physicians treat 
      90 percent of patients presenting with one or more anxiety disorders. Common anxiety 
      disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. 
      Differentiation among these disorders may be difficult, since symptoms and 
      presentations are often similar. Underlying medical disorders and depressive illness 
      may mimic or coexist with anxiety disorders. The chronic, remitting and relapsing 
      nature of anxiety disorders requires the institution of a long-term plan of care. 
      The integration of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions generally 
      produces the greatest benefit to patients. Pharmacotherapeutic options frequently 
      prescribed by family physicians include benzodiazepines, beta blockers, monoamine 
      oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and azapirones. Useful 
      psychotherapeutic models featuring brief interventions include supportive and 
      cognitive approaches, and behavioral therapies, such as biofeedback, in vivo 
      exposure and systematic desensitization.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anxiety disorders are among the main psychiatric conditions 
      co-occuring with bipolar disorders. Many clinical and epidemiological studies have 
      found much higher prevalence rates of generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in 
      bipolar patients than in the general population, regardless of age. In the National 
      Comorbidity Survey for instance, the diagnosis of at least one anxiety disorder was 
      made for nearly 90% of bipolar subjects. Several issues arise from this high 
      comorbidity, such as the way anxiety disorders alter the course and prognosis of the 
      mood disorder, and challenge typical therapeutic strategies. This article reviews 
      data on clinical and therapeutical significance of such comorbidity. LITERATURE 
      FINDINGS: Many studies point out the poorer outcome for bipolar patients with 
      co-occurring anxiety symptoms: apart from the alarming increase of suicidal ideas 
      and suicide attempts, authors have found a shorter duration of euthymia, more 
      comorbid addictions, mixed states and rapid cycling, and lower response to 
      treatments. This is the reason why monitoring the suicidal risk in those bipolar 
      patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders is of critical importance. From a 
      physiopathological standpoint, the precise links between both pathologies remains 
      unclear. The frequency of this comorbidity and its significance on long term 
      prognosis stands in sharp contrast with the very few therapeutic studies conducted 
      in this indication so far. Pharmacological approaches are strongly limited by the 
      risk of mood switching under antidepressants and drug dependence on anxiolytics such 
      as benzodiazepines. Nevertheless, there is emerging evidence of the interest of 
      atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and mood stabilisers such as lamotrigine 
      to control anxiety symptoms in bipolar patients. There is weaker evidence for other 
      molecules. Taking into account other therapeutic approaches than the pharmacological 
      approach appears accurate. Psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavioral 
      therapies or psychoeducation appear essential to improve in a correct way the global 
      functioning and quality of life of these patients.

LID - 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.084756 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-help interventions for psychiatric disorders represent an 
      increasingly popular alternative to therapist-administered psychological therapies, 
      offering the potential of increased access to cost-effective treatment. AIMS: To 
      determine the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of self-help 
      interventions for anxiety disorders. METHOD: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 
      self-help interventions for anxiety disorders were identified by searching nine 
      online databases. Studies were grouped according to disorder and meta-analyses were 
      conducted where sufficient data were available. Overall meta-analyses of self-help 
      v. waiting list and therapist-administered treatment were also undertaken. 
      Methodological quality was assessed independently by two researchers according to 
      criteria set out by the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: Thirty-one RCTs met 
      inclusion criteria for the review. Results of the overall meta-analysis comparing 
      self-help with waiting list gave a significant effect size of 0.84 in favour of 
      self-help. Comparison of self-help with therapist-administered treatments revealed a 
      significant difference in favour of the latter with an effect size of 0.34. The 
      addition of guidance and the presentation of multimedia or web-based self-help 
      materials improved treatment outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Self-help interventions appear to 
      be an effective way of treating individuals diagnosed with social phobia and panic 
      disorder. Further research is required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and 
      acceptability of these interventions.

TI  - Virtual reality treatment of flying phobia.
PG  - 206-12
AB  - Flying phobia (FP) might become a very incapacitating and disturbing problem in a 
      person's social, working, and private areas. Psychological interventions based on 
      exposure therapy have proved to be effective, but given the particular nature of 
      this disorder they bear important limitations. Exposure therapy for FP might be 
      excessively costly in terms of time, money, and efforts. Virtual reality (VR) 
      overcomes these difficulties as different significant environments might be created, 
      where the patient can interact with what he or she fears while in a totally safe and 
      protected environment-the therapist's consulting room. This paper intends, on one 
      hand, to show the different scenarios designed by our team for the VR treatment of 
      FP, and on the other, to present the first results supporting the effectiveness of 
      this new tool for the treatment of FP in a multiple baseline study.

TI  - The etiology of social phobia.
PG  - 10-6
AB  - Human beings are by nature social animals, but for some, social scrutiny is a source 
      of extreme anguish. Those with social phobia, for example, suffer excessive and 
      often disabling concern about potential and real social-evaluative threat. As new 
      and effective therapies for this condition are pursued, there is a simultaneous 
      movement to extend the understanding of this disorder's etiology. In psychiatry, as 
      in the rest of medicine, this development of new treatments often occurs in parallel 
      with increasing sophistication about causes of illness. Advances in one area 
      typically inform and predictably lead to advances in the other. Social phobia is 
      recognized as a relatively common and significantly impairing anxiety disorder. As 
      with other psychiatric disorders, emerging models of the etiology of social phobia 
      are derived from converging evidence of interacting biological and environmental 
      contributions. Current theories regarding the evolution of social phobia will be 
      addressed, including biological preparedness to fear scrutiny by others, genetically 
      transmitted predisposition to fear acquisition, nongenetic familial and 
      environmental factors, as well as other possible causes and antecedents. 
      Additionally, we describe recent work on behavioral inhibition in infancy as an 
      identifiable early marker of proneness to the development of anxiety disorders, 
      including social phobia.

TI  - Therapeutic strategies for the patient with treatment-resistant anxiety.
PG  - 69-74
AB  - Outcome of anxiety disorder treatment with psychotherapy and medication is generally 
      as good as or better than that of other psychiatric illnesses. Nevertheless, 
      refractory cases occur. The first step in approaching the treatment-resistant 
      patient with an anxiety disorder is to be certain that the treatment has been 
      adequate. Failure to provide an adequate dose of medication for adequate periods of 
      time may be the most common cause of "treatment resistance." The second step is to 
      reconsider the diagnosis and/or determine if new diagnoses have emerged since the 
      original consultation. Depression and substance abuse are especially likely to 
      complicate anxiety disorders. Several studies have shown that concomitant 
      personality disorders (axis II) increase the occurrence of resistance to standard 
      treatment and must be addressed through psychotherapy. Last, a variety of possible 
      underlying medical conditions, including thyroid disorder, arrhythmia, and complex 
      partial seizure, should be considered. Then, the clinician should consider a variety 
      of pharmacologic approaches that are specific to each anxiety disorder. Panic 
      disorder patients who are refractory to imipramine frequently respond to 
      high-potency benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors, or various combinations. Generalized anxiety disorder, if unresponsive 
      to benzodiazepines, may respond to buspirone or a tricyclic antidepressant. Patients 
      with obsessive compulsive disorder who have failed to respond to clomipramine or 
      fluoxetine and other serotonin reuptake blockers may benefit from augmentation 
      strategies using combination therapies including buspirone, fenfluramine, and 
      neuroleptics. Social phobia refractory to beta-blockers and MAO inhibitors may 
      benefit from buspirone, fenfluramine, and neuroleptics. Social phobia refractory to 
      beta-blockers and MAO inhibitors may benefit from buspirone, fluoxetine, or 
      alprazolam.

AB  - Exposure therapy is a highly effective, evidence-based treatment technique for 
      children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Regardless, therapists in the 
      community are reported to use exposure relatively rarely compared with other 
      approaches. The goal of the present study was to identify how practicing clinicians 
      treat youth with anxiety disorders across the United States and what factors 
      contribute to their use of exposure therapy. Recruited from public directories, 257 
      private practice therapists who treat anxious youth were surveyed. Non-exposure 
      cognitive-behavioral techniques like cognitive restructuring and relaxation 
      techniques were used significantly more frequently than exposure. Providers with 
      more training in exposure therapy and fewer negative beliefs about this approach 
      reported using exposure significantly more in the treatment of youth with social 
      anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and panic disorders. Self-identification as an 
      anxiety disorder specialist significantly predicted exposure use for youth with 
      posttraumatic stress disorder. Most therapists in private practice have minimal 
      training in exposure therapy, perceive a lack of training options, and believe there 
      would be a benefit to acquiring more training. The implications of these findings 
      are discussed, including how to optimally design training opportunities in exposure 
      therapy.

TI  - [Anticonvulsants in the treatment of anxiety--an alternative treatment option?].
PG  - 1274-82
AB  - According to epidemiological studies anxiety disorders are among the most frequent 
      psychiatric disorders. Depending on the diagnosis and severity, both cognitive 
      behaviour therapy and pharmacological approaches are applied. In today's drug 
      therapy antidepressants are the standard first-line treatment for most anxiety 
      disorders, and enzodiazepines for the treatment of acute anxiety states. However, 
      many patients do not respond to the first drug prescribed, prove to have conditions 
      that are resistant to therapy or complain of side effects. There is therefore still 
      a need for new medicamentous treatment strategies. There are numerous studies 
      suggesting that anticonvulsants also have potentially anxiolytic properties and 
      might therefore be an alternative treatment option in anxiety syndromes. This 
      article gives an overview of investigations to date on the effects of various 
      anticonvulsants in panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia.

PG  - 91-103
AB  - Between 2% and 5% of the population are affected by anxiety disorders. Several 
      studies have shown that imipramine possesses anti-panic and anti-phobic properties. 
      Its response rate is at least 70%. In panic disorder with agoraphobia it is 
      therefore the medication of first choice. Agoraphobia, simple and social phobias are 
      highly responsive to behavioural therapy (desensitization, flooding, social skills 
      training, cognitive restructuring). Drugs have not been found useful in controlled 
      studies. In conjunction with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, behavioural 
      therapy is superior to other psychotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of 
      obsessive-compulsive disorders. Patients suffering from posttraumatic stress 
      disorders require first of all supportive psychotherapy. Pharmacological treatment 
      is of limited value. Neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants and 
      beta-blockers are the most appropriate agents for the treatment of generalised 
      anxiety disorders. In addition to that, intense psychotherapy and relaxation 
      techniques should be applied. Further research should address the question of 
      relapse rates after termination of therapy and the elaboration of therapeutic 
      strategies that take individual psychopathology into consideration.

TI  - Effect of Psychological Intervention on Fear of Cancer Recurrence: A Systematic 
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 2899-2915
LID - 10.1200/JCO.19.00572 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a significantly distressing problem that 
      affects a substantial number of patients with and survivors of cancer; however, the 
      overall efficacy of available psychological interventions on FCR remains unknown. We 
      therefore evaluated this in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. 
      METHODS: We searched key electronic databases to identify trials that evaluated the 
      effect of psychological interventions on FCR among patients with and survivors of 
      cancer. Controlled trials were subjected to meta-analysis, and the moderating 
      influence of study characteristics on the effect were examined. Overall quality of 
      evidence was evaluated using the GRADE system. Open trials were narratively reviewed 
      to explore ongoing developments in the field (PROSPERO registration no.: 
      CRD42017076514). RESULTS: A total of 23 controlled trials (21 randomized controlled 
      trials) and nine open trials were included. Small effects (Hedges's g) were found 
      both at postintervention (g = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.46; P < .001) and at follow-up 
      (g = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.40; P < .001). Effects at postintervention of 
      contemporary cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs; g = 0.42) were larger than those 
      of traditional CBTs (g = 0.24; β = .22; 95% CI, .04 to .41; P = .018). At follow-up, 
      larger effects were associated with shorter time to follow-up (β = -.01; 95% CI, 
      -.01 to -.00; P = .027) and group-based formats (β = .18; 95% CI, .01 to .36; P = 
      .041). A GRADE evaluation indicated evidence of moderate strength for effects of 
      psychological intervention for FCR. CONCLUSION: Psychological interventions for FCR 
      revealed a small but robust effect at postintervention, which was largely maintained 
      at follow-up. Larger postintervention effects were found for contemporary CBTs that 
      were focused on processes of cognition-for example, worry, rumination, and 
      attentional bias-rather than the content, and aimed to change the way in which the 
      individual relates to his or her inner experiences. Future trials could investigate 
      how to further optimize and tailor interventions to individual patients' FCR 
      presentation.

TI  - A Novel Treatment of Fear of Flying Using a Large Virtual Reality System.
PG  - 411-6
LID - 10.3357/AMHP.4485.2016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear of flying (FoF), a common phobia in the developed world, is usually 
      treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, most efficiently when combined with 
      exposure methods, e.g., virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). We evaluated FoF 
      treatment using VRET in a large motion-based VR system. The treated subjects were 
      seated on a moving platform. The virtual scenery included the interior of an 
      aircraft and a window view to the outside world accompanied by platform movements 
      simulating, e.g., takeoff, landing, and air turbulence. Relevant auditory stimuli 
      were also incorporated. CASE REPORT: Three male patients with FoF underwent a 
      clinical interview followed by three VRETs in the presence and with the guidance of 
      a therapist. Scores on the Flight Anxiety Situation (FAS) and Flight Anxiety 
      Modality (FAM) questionnaires were obtained on the first and fourth visits. Anxiety 
      levels were assessed using the subjective units of distress (SUDs) scale during the 
      exposure. All three subjects expressed satisfaction regarding the procedure and did 
      not skip or avoid any of its stages. Consistent improvement was seen in the SUDs 
      throughout the VRET session and across sessions, while patients' scores on the FAS 
      and FAM showed inconsistent trends. Two patients participated in actual flights in 
      the months following the treatment, bringing 12 and 16 yr of avoidance to an end. 
      DISCUSSION: This VR-based treatment includes critical elements for exposure of 
      flying experience beyond visual and auditory stimuli. The current case reports 
      suggest VRET sessions may have a meaningful impact on anxiety levels, yet additional 
      research seems warranted.

LID - 10.1007/s00105-016-3762-x [doi]
AB  - Between 0.8 and 1.8 % of the German population suffers from a body dysmorphic 
      disorder. In specific settings like dermatological offices up to 11.9 % of patients 
      suffer from this disease. The highest prevalence could be found in the field of 
      cosmetic dermatology with a prevalence of 13.1 %. Until now, the diagnosis has been 
      made too rarely. The body dysmorphic disorder is a chronic psychic disease, in which 
      the patients feel disfigured and experience shame and disgust at the same time. 
      Comorbidities like social phobia, depression, suicidality, and eating disorders are 
      frequent. The diagnosis is made using questionnaires (e.g., dysmorphic concern 
      questionnaire) or by use of the DSM-5 manual. An early diagnosis seems to be 
      important to avoid chronification and suicidal ideas. Therapeutic approaches should 
      include cognitive behavioral therapies as well as the use of SSRIs.

TI  - Changes in quality of life following cognitive-behavioral group therapy for panic 
      disorder.
PG  - 8-14
LID - 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2009.05.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data about quality of life (QoL) are important to estimate the impact of 
      diseases on functioning and well-being. The present study was designed to assess the 
      association of different aspects of panic disorder (PD) with QoL and to examine the 
      relationship between QoL and symptomatic outcome following brief 
      cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT). METHOD: The sample consisted of 55 
      consecutively recruited outpatients suffering from PD who underwent CBGT. QoL was 
      assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) at 
      baseline, post-treatment and six months follow-up. SF-36 baseline scores were 
      compared with normative data obtained from a large German population sample. 
      RESULTS: Agoraphobia, disability, and worries about health were significantly 
      associated with decreased QoL, whereas frequency, severity and duration of panic 
      attacks were not. Treatment responders showed significantly better QoL than 
      non-responders. PD symptom reduction following CBGT was associated with considerable 
      improvement in emotional and physical aspects of QoL. However, the vitality subscale 
      of the SF-36 remained largely unchanged over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are 
      encouraging for cognitive-behavior therapists who treat patients suffering from PD 
      in groups, since decrease of PD symptoms appears to be associated with considerable 
      improvements in QoL. Nevertheless, additional interventions designed to target 
      specific aspects of QoL, in particular vitality, may be useful to enhance patients' 
      well-being.

TI  - Non-drug treatment for social phobia.
PG  - 65-70
AB  - When controlled studies on currently available non-drug treatments for social phobia 
      were reviewed, short-term effectiveness was evident for social skills training, 
      exposure therapy and cognitive therapy. The combination of exposure and cognitive 
      therapy may have some superiority over the separate treatments. Group therapy and 
      individual therapy did not differ clearly in outcome, while attempts to match 
      treatment and patient characteristics have so far failed to produce consistently 
      better results. With follow-up periods of either less than a year or more than a 
      year, the therapies reviewed appeared to lead to stable results, although the 
      available data allowed no firm conclusions because of attrition and additional 
      treatments during the follow-up period. Except for the recent landmark study by 
      Heimberg and Liebowitz, cognitive behavior therapy has not been adequately compared 
      to medication. Studies are needed to assess the value of cognitive behavior therapy 
      in combination with medication and to explore the possibilities of self-help manuals 
      in such combination studies.

PG  - 83-9
AB  - Choking phobia is characterized by fear and avoidance of swallowing food, fluids, or 
      pills. Most individuals with this phobia suddenly acquire their fear after an 
      episode of choking on food. Fear of choking appears to occur somewhat more often in 
      females than in males, and has a variable age of onset ranging from childhood to old 
      age. Its prevalence is unknown. Choking phobia appears responsive to antipanic 
      medication and to certain cognitive and behavioral therapies.

TI  - [Anxiety disorders: which psychotherapy for whom?].
PG  - 271-275
LID - 10.1007/s00115-018-0481-9 [doi]
AB  - According to the Federal Healthcare Survey (Bundesgesundheitssurvey), approximately 
      15% of the German population fulfil the diagnostic criteria for at least one anxiety 
      disorder within (any) 1 year. Women are affected approximately twice as often as 
      men. The study by the Robert Koch Institute included the systematic assessment of 
      panic disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder 
      and specific phobias; therefore, the question for both those affected and the 
      treating therapist is "anxiety disorders: which psychotherapy for whom?" is of great 
      clinical and healthcare political importance. We therefore review the available 
      literature for answering three more specific questions: 1) what are the most 
      suitable forms of psychotherapy, 2) which psychotherapy is most promising for an 
      individual patient and diagnosis (differential evaluation of indications) and 
      3) what is the best approach to nonresponse or avoidance of the treatment offered? 
      National and international guidelines agree that cognitive behavioral therapy is the 
      psychotherapy of first choice in most patients with anxiety disorders. In cases of 
      nonresponse or lack of availability of the appropriate therapy, psychodynamic 
      therapy or pharmacotherapy can also be recommended. For individualized treatment 
      recommendations we do not have empirical evidence. Also, no evidence-based 
      (individual) recommendations are available for non-responders;however, there are 
      some preferred strategies based on a clinical consensus.

      supported by findings from primary studies and earlier meta-analyses. However, a 
      comprehensive summary of the recent evidence is still pending. This meta-analysis 
      investigates the efficacy of group psychotherapy for adult patients with SAD. A 
      literature search identified 36 randomized-controlled trials examining 2171 
      patients. Available studies used mainly cognitive-behavioral group therapies (CBGT); 
      therefore, quantitative analyses were done for CBGT. Medium to large positive 
      effects emerged for wait list-controlled trials for specific symptomatology: g=0.84, 
      95% CI [0.72; 0.97] and general psychopathology: g=0.62, 95% CI [0.36; 0.89]. Group 
      psychotherapy was also superior to common factor control conditions in alleviating 
      symptoms of SAD, but not in improving general psychopathology. No differences 
      appeared for direct comparisons of group psychotherapy and individual psychotherapy 
      or pharmacotherapy. Hence, group psychotherapy for SAD is an efficacious treatment, 
      equivalent to other treatment formats.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder manifests after exposure to a traumatic event and is 
      characterized by avoidance/numbing, intrusive symptoms and flashbacks, mood and 
      cognitive disruptions, and hyperarousal/reactivity symptoms. These symptoms reflect 
      dysregulation of the fear system likely caused by poor fear inhibition/extinction, 
      increased generalization, and/or enhanced consolidation or acquisition of fear. 
      These phenotypes can be modeled in animal subjects using Pavlovian fear 
      conditioning, allowing investigation of the underlying neurobiology of normative and 
      pathological fear. Preclinical studies reveal a number of neurotransmitter systems 
      and circuits critical for aversive learning and memory that have informed the 
      development of therapies used in human clinical trials. In this review, we discuss 
      the evidence for a number of established and emerging pharmacotherapies and 
      device-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder that have been developed 
      via a bench to bedside translational model.

AB  - Music performance anxiety (MPA) regularly occurs when musicians present themselves 
      before an audience in performance situations, and thus, it plays an important role 
      in the careers of professional musicians. MPA is expressed on the emotional and 
      physical level, as well as on the levels of thinking and behavior, and extends along 
      a continuum of varying severity. Its performance-impairing, afflicting form is 
      considered to be a specific type of social phobia, which requires therapy. There are 
      different psychological theories, which contribute to the understanding of the 
      phenomenon of MPA and provide basic principles for the various treatment approaches. 
      Current "best practice," in our clinical experience, is a personal- and 
      problem-oriented approach within a multimodal therapy model, including the range of 
      psychoanalytic and cognitive behavioral therapies, body-oriented methods, and mental 
      techniques. In order to avoid severe MPA, prevention in the field of music pedagogic 
      is very important. Thus, the concepts of dealing positively with MPA should be 
      implemented very early into the instrumental and vocal education of musicians.

AB  - d-Cycloserine (DCS), a co-agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, has 
      proven to be an effective adjunct to cognitive behavioral therapies that utilize 
      extinction. This pharmacological-based enhancement of extinction memory has been 
      primarily demonstrated in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by pathological 
      fear (e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder and various phobias). More recently, there 
      has been an interest in applying such a strategy in the disorders of appetitive 
      learning (e.g. substance abuse and other addictions), but these studies have 
      generated mixed results. Here we first examined whether extinction memory encoding 
      in a sucrose self-administration model is dependent on NMDA receptors. The NMDA 
      antagonist (±)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (5mg/kg, i.p.) 
      administered 2h prior to the first extinction training session effectively inhibited 
      extinction memory recall 24h later, without affecting the expression of the 
      conditioned sucrose-seeking response while the drug was on board. This profile of 
      effects suggests a specific effect on extinction memory consolidation. Next, we 
      sought to enhance extinction memory using the co-agonist DCS (10 μg/side) by 
      infusion directly into infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex, a brain site implicated 
      in extinction memory recall in conditioned fear models. Indeed, infusion of DCS 
      immediately after the first extinction training session effectively enhanced 
      extinction memory recall 24h later. Collectively, these data suggest that the 
      neurobiological mechanisms and the neurocircuitry mediating extinction memory are 
      similar regardless of the valence (aversive or appetitive) of the conditioned 
      behavior, and that similar pharmacological strategies for treatment may be applied 
      to neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by a failure to inhibit pathological 
      emotional memories.

LID - 10.1002/jclp.20536 [doi]
AB  - Internet-and computer-based cognitive-behavioral treatments have been introduced as 
      novel approaches to deliver standard, quality treatment that may reduce barriers to 
      care. The purpose of this review is to quantitatively summarize the literature 
      examining the treatment effects of Internet- or computer-based treatment (ICT) on 
      anxiety. Nineteen randomized controlled ICT trials were identified and subjected to 
      fixed and random effects meta-analytic techniques. Weighted mean effect sizes 
      (Cohen's d) showed that ICT was superior to waitlist and placebo assignment across 
      outcome measures (ds=.49-1.14). The effects of ICT also were equal to 
      therapist-delivered treatment across anxiety disorders. However, conclusions were 
      limited by small sample sizes, the rare use of placebo controls, and other 
      methodological problems. In addition, the number of available studies limited the 
      opportunity to conduct analyses by diagnostic group; there was preliminary support 
      for the use of ICT for panic disorder and phobia. Large, well-designed, 
      placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm and extend the results of this 
      meta-analysis.

TI  - Advances in behavioral-cognitive therapy of social phobia.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - Behavioral-cognitive therapy is a cost-effective treatment for social phobia. The 
      doctor's role is to teach the patient how to do successful self-exposure. The 
      clinician acts as a guide and monitor; there is no need to waste time accompanying 
      the patient into the phobic situation. The patient first reads a self-exposure 
      manual to learn how to confront panic-evoking social cues for prolonged period 
      without avoidance until habituation sets in. This might require an hour daily of 
      self-exposure over weeks or months. As patients habituate to social cues to which 
      they have exposed themselves, they arrange exposure to fresh cues until they become 
      used to all. The patient tracks progress by recording completed exposure-homework 
      tasks in a daily diary. In instances where it is technically difficult to do regular 
      exposure, the patient carries out imagined tape-recorded exposure in his/her own 
      voice. The therapist can briefly help the patient role-play such exposure. Rational 
      role-play enhances outcome of body dysmorphic disorder or delusional disorder 
      somatic type with prominent social phobia. Cognitive therapy can be useful. Most 
      social phobics improve with behavioral-cognitive treatment without medication. When 
      patients have low mood, concurrent antidepressants can be synergistic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a common existential concern and 
      source of distress among adults with a cancer history. Multiple randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) have examined mind-body approaches to mitigating FCR. We 
      summarized characteristics of these trials and calculated their pooled effects on 
      decreasing FCR. METHODS: Six electronic databases were systematically searched from 
      inception to May 2017, using a strategy that included multiple terms for RCTs, 
      cancer, mind-body medicine, and FCR. Data extraction and reporting followed Cochrane 
      and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines. Pooled effect sizes on self-report measures of FCR were computed by 
      using random-effects models. RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs (pooled N = 2806) were included. 
      Most studies (53%) were published since 2015 and targeted a single cancer type (84%; 
      mostly breast). Intervention sessions (median = 6, mode = 4) tended to last 
      120 minutes and occur across 1.5 months. Delivery was predominantly in-person (63%) 
      to either groups (42%) or individuals (42%). Most interventions incorporated 
      multiple mind-body components (53%), commonly cognitive-behavioral skills (58%), or 
      meditative practices (53%). Small-to-medium pooled effect sizes were observed 
      postintervention (Hedges' g = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.49, -0.23, P < .001) and at 
      follow-up assessments (median = 8 months, P < .001). Potential modifiers (control 
      group design, group/individual delivery, use of cognitive-behavioral or mindfulness 
      skills, number of mind-body components, cancer treatment status, and number of 
      sessions) did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Mind-body 
      interventions are efficacious for reducing FCR, with small-to-medium effect sizes 
      that persist after intervention delivery ends. Recommendations include testing 
      effects among survivors of various cancers and exploring the optimal integration of 
      mind-body practices for managing fundamental uncertainties and fears during cancer 
      survivorship.

AB  - Exposure-based psychological treatments for anxiety have high efficacy. However, a 
      substantial proportion of patients do not respond to therapy. Research examining the 
      potential biological underpinnings of therapy response is still in its infancy, and 
      most studies have focussed on candidate genes. To our knowledge, this study 
      represents the first investigation of genome-wide expression profiles with respect 
      to treatment outcome. Participants (n=102) with panic disorder or specific phobia 
      received exposure-based cognitive behavioural therapy. Treatment outcome was defined 
      as percentage reduction from baseline in clinician-rated severity of their primary 
      anxiety diagnosis at post treatment and 6 month follow-up. Gene expression was 
      determined from whole blood samples at three time points using the Illumina HT-12v4 
      BeadChip microarray. Linear regression models tested the association between 
      treatment outcome and changes in gene expression from pre-treatment to post 
      treatment, and pre-treatment to follow-up. Network analysis was conducted using 
      weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and change in the detected modules 
      from pre-treatment to post treatment and follow-up was tested for association with 
      treatment outcome. No changes in gene expression were significantly associated with 
      treatment outcomes when correcting for multiple testing (q<0.05), although a small 
      number of genes showed a suggestive association with treatment outcome (q<0.5, 
      n=20). Network analysis showed no association between treatment outcome and change 
      in gene expression for any module. We report suggestive evidence for the role of a 
      small number of genes in treatment outcome. Although preliminary, these findings 
      contribute to a growing body of research suggesting that response to psychological 
      therapies may be associated with changes at a biological level.

PG  - 58-60
AB  - The patient facing the dentist knows fear, anxiety. The symbolism of the mouth and 
      teeth from childhood is an entirely specific nature of the human body. The 
      terrifying image of dental treatment and dentist that has long been stigmatized 
      through painting, literature, theater and cinema can change today. Many therapeutic 
      options to the management of anxiety in dental phobia; anesthesia, conscious 
      sedation, combined with a soothing cabinet, a caring dentist, targeted use of 
      medications or milder alternative methods; homeopathy, herbal medicine, acupuncture, 
      psychotherapy, places the patient's interests at the center of the caregiving 
      relationship. But this treatment panel is also offered him the difficulty of the 
      choice. This exercise without systematization, according to the patient with 
      competence and kindness. Some patients may be sent or processed in collaboration 
      with other health professionals.

TI  - A randomized trial of sertraline, self-administered cognitive behavior therapy, and 
      their combination for panic disorder.
PG  - 373-83
LID - 10.1017/S0033291710000930 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-administered cognitive behavior therapy (SCBT) has been shown to be 
      an effective alternative to therapist-delivered treatment for panic disorder (PD). 
      However, it is unknown whether combining SCBT and antidepressants can improve 
      treatment. This trial evaluated the efficacy of SCBT and sertraline, alone or in 
      combination, in PD. METHOD: Patients (n=251) were randomized to 12 weeks of either 
      placebo drug, placebo drug plus SCBT, sertraline, or sertraline plus SCBT. Those who 
      improved after 12 weeks of acute treatment received treatment for an additional 12 
      weeks. Outcome measures included core PD symptoms (panic attacks, anticipatory 
      anxiety, agoraphobic avoidance), dysfunctional cognitions (fear of bodily 
      sensations, agoraphobic cognitions), disability, and clinical global impression of 
      severity and improvement. Efficacy data were analyzed using general and generalized 
      linear mixed models. RESULTS: Primary analyses of trends over time revealed that 
      sertraline/SCBT produced a significantly greater rate of decline in fear of bodily 
      sensations compared to sertraline, placebo/SCBT and placebo. Trends in other 
      outcomes were not significantly different over time. Secondary analyses of mean 
      scores at week 12 revealed that sertraline/SCBT fared better on several outcomes 
      than placebo, with improvement being maintained at the end of continuation 
      treatment. Outcome did not differ between placebo and either sertraline monotherapy 
      or placebo/SCBT. Moreover, few differences emerged between the active interventions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This trial suggests that sertraline combined with SCBT may be an 
      effective treatment for PD. The study could not confirm the efficacy of sertraline 
      monotherapy or SCBT without concomitant medication or therapist assistance in the 
      treatment of PD.

PG  - 5-11
LID - 10.1002/da.20601 [doi]
AB  - By comparing efficacious psychological therapies of different kinds, inferences 
      about common effective treatment mechanisms can be made. We selected six therapies 
      for review on the basis of the diversity of their theoretical rationales and 
      evidence for superior efficacy: psychoanalytic psychotherapy, hypercapnic breathing 
      training, hypocapnic breathing training, reprocessing with and without eye-movement 
      desensitization, muscle relaxation, and cognitive behavior therapy. The likely 
      common element of all these therapies is that they reduce the immediate expectancy 
      of a panic attack, disrupting the vicious circle of fearing fear. Modifying 
      expectation is usually regarded as a placebo mechanism in psychotherapy, but may be 
      a specific treatment mechanism for panic. The fact that this is seldom the rationale 
      communicated to the patient creates a moral dilemma: Is it ethical for therapists to 
      mislead patients to help them? Pragmatic justification of a successful practice is a 
      way out of this dilemma. Therapies should be evaluated that deal with expectations 
      directly by promoting positive thinking or by fostering non-expectancy.

LID - 10.1016/j.beth.2007.07.003 [doi]
AB  - One-Session Treatment (OST) is a form of massed exposure therapy for the treatment 
      of specific phobias. OST combines exposure, participant modeling, cognitive 
      challenges, and reinforcement in a single session, maximized to three hours. Clients 
      are gradually exposed to steps of their fear hierarchy using therapist-directed 
      behavioral experiments. Although there are several studies in the literature 
      examining the efficacy of OST, little has been done to summarize this research. In 
      the following review, research on and empirical support for OST are reviewed with an 
      emphasis on the types of stimuli, samples, and methodologies utilized. Research 
      generally supports OST's efficacy, although replication by independent examiners 
      using adult and child samples is needed using more rigorous comparisons (e.g., 
      psychological placebo or other treatments). Overall, OST continues to be a promising 
      treatment for specific phobias; however, a great deal more investigation is needed 
      to identify mechanisms of change, mediators, and moderators.

TI  - Combined psychotherapy plus antidepressants for panic disorder with or without 
      agoraphobia.
PG  - CD004364
LID - CD004364
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder can be treated with pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy or in 
      combination, but the relative merits of combined therapy have not been well 
      established. OBJECTIVES: To review evidence concerning short- and long-term 
      advantages and disadvantages of combined psychotherapy plus antidepressant treatment 
      for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, in comparison with either therapy 
      alone. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis 
      Controlled Trials Registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched 
      on 11/10/2005, together with a complementary search of the Cochrane Central Register 
      of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE, using the keywords antidepressant and panic. A 
      reference search, SciSearch and personal contact with experts were carried out. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Two independent review authors identified randomised controlled 
      trials comparing the combined therapy against either of the monotherapies among 
      adult patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Two independent review authors extracted data using predefined data 
      formats, including study quality indicators. The primary outcome was relative risk 
      (RR) of "response" i.e. substantial overall improvement from baseline as defined by 
      the original investigators. Secondary outcomes included standardised weighted mean 
      differences in global severity, panic attack frequency, phobic avoidance, general 
      anxiety, depression and social functioning and relative risks of overall dropouts 
      and dropouts due to side effects. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 23 randomised 
      comparisons (representing 21 trials, 1709 patients), 21 of which involved behaviour 
      or cognitive-behaviour therapies. In the acute phase treatment, the combined therapy 
      was superior to antidepressant pharmacotherapy (RR 1.24, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 1.02 to 1.52) or psychotherapy (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31). The combined 
      therapy produced more dropouts due to side effects than psychotherapy (number needed 
      to harm (NNH) around 26). After the acute phase treatment, as long as the drug was 
      continued, the superiority of the combination over either monotherapy appeared to 
      persist. After termination of the acute phase and continuation treatment, the 
      combined therapy was more effective than pharmacotherapy alone (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.23 
      to 2.11) and was as effective as psychotherapy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.16). 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Either combined therapy or psychotherapy alone may be chosen 
      as first line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, depending on 
      patient preference.

TI  - [Anxiety disorders in the elderly: Clinical and therapeutic aspects].
PG  - 179-87
AB  - Few studies have been specifically devoted to anxiety disorders in the elderly. 
      Nevertheless, various factors can expose this population to relevant levels of 
      anxiety: development of somatic disorders, bereavements, isolation, changes of life, 
      use of anxiogenic drugs, etc. Prevalence rates weaker than in the general population 
      are usually found, but with high rates, however, for generalized anxiety disorder 
      and agoraphobia. The clinical aspect of these anxious states is often dominated by 
      somatic symptoms and complaints, and some topics seem of special concern: fear of 
      death and disease, displacement phobias related to the fear of falling or being 
      attacked. Some consequences should be particularly watched over (diverse somatic 
      affections, depression, dementia, and even suicidal tendencies), which justify an 
      accurate clinical evaluation. Treatment must often be multidisciplinary involving 
      medical but also psychological, and institutional aspects. The therapeutic 
      strategies are largely identical to what they are in the other groups of age. 
      Anxiolytic drugs and antidepressants, cognitive-behavioral therapies can be 
      proposed, even if some adaptation of drug posology or methods of non pharmacological 
      interventions should be needed. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of 
      benzodiazepine dependence, drugs which are widely used by elderly subjects. As a 
      conclusion, anxiety disorders in the elderly present clinical and therapeutic 
      particularities, which require a special approach and the development of specific 
      epidemiological, physiopathologic and therapeutic researches.

TI  - Cognitive enhancers as adjuncts to psychotherapy: use of D-cycloserine in phobic 
      individuals to facilitate extinction of fear.
PG  - 1136-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional pharmacological approaches to treating psychiatric disorders 
      focus on correcting presumed biochemical abnormalities. However, some disorders, 
      particularly the anxiety-related disorders exemplified by specific phobia, have an 
      emotional learning component to them that can be facilitated with psychotherapy. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the 
      N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor that has previously been shown to improve extinction 
      of fear in rodents, will also improve extinction of fear in human phobic patients 
      undergoing behavioral exposure therapy. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial examining DCS vs placebo treatment in combination with a 
      precisely controlled exposure paradigm. SETTING: Participants were recruited from 
      the general community to a research clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight subjects with 
      acrophobia diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV were enrolled. 
      INTERVENTIONS: After we obtained pretreatment measures of fear, subjects were 
      treated with 2 sessions of behavioral exposure therapy using virtual reality 
      exposure to heights within a virtual glass elevator. Single doses of placebo or DCS 
      were taken prior to each of the 2 sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy. 
      Subjects, therapists, and assessors were blind to the treatment condition. Subjects 
      returned at 1 week and 3 months posttreatment for measures to determine the presence 
      and severity of acrophobia symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Included were measures 
      of acrophobia within the virtual environment, measures of acrophobia in the real 
      world, and general measures of overall improvement. An objective measure of fear, 
      electrodermal skin fluctuation, was also included during the virtual exposure to 
      heights. Symptoms were assessed by self-report and by independent assessors at 
      approximately 1 week and 3 months posttreatment. RESULTS: Exposure therapy combined 
      with DCS resulted in significantly larger reductions of acrophobia symptoms on all 
      main outcome measures. Subjects receiving DCS had significantly more improvement 
      compared with subjects receiving placebo within the virtual environment (1 week 
      after treatment, P</=.001; 3 months later, P</=.05). Subjects receiving DCS also 
      showed significantly greater decreases in posttreatment skin conductance 
      fluctuations during the virtual exposure (P</=.05). Additionally, subjects receiving 
      DCS had significantly greater improvement compared with subjects receiving placebo 
      on general measures of real-world acrophobia symptoms (acrophobia avoidance 
      [P</=.02], acrophobia anxiety [P</=.01], attitudes toward heights [P</=.04], 
      clinical global improvement [P</=.01], and number of self-exposures to real-world 
      heights [P</=.01]); the improvement was evident early in treatment and was 
      maintained at 3 months. CONCLUSION: These pilot data provide initial support for the 
      use of acute dosing of DCS as an adjunct to exposure-based psychotherapy to 
      accelerate the associative learning processes that contribute to correcting 
      psychopathology.

TI  - Characteristics of patients with social phobia and their treatment in specialized 
      clinics for anxiety disorders in the Netherlands.
PG  - 123-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social phobia frequently occurs in the general population but is 
      probably underreported due to comorbid disorders which mask the social phobia. 
      Another reason might be that patients do not consult their general pratitioner due 
      to embarrassment or an estimation of their condition. There are several treatments 
      available for social phobia, but not enough is known about the efficacy of the 
      different treatments strategies. METHODS: A retrospective, medical record-based 
      study was carried out in four outpatient clinics specializing in treatment of 
      anxiety disorders to investigate the characteristics of 64 patients with a DSM-IV 
      axis diagnosis of social phobia who seeked help for their problems. Therapies for 
      social phobia within these clinics and differences between these clinics were 
      evaluated. RESULTS: Men with a high educational level tended to seek more help and 
      comorbid disorders tended to cause more impairment in functioning. Further, there is 
      a large delay between onset and therapy attendance (mean 14 years). Finally, there 
      was consistency in the treatment of social phobia in these four clinics which 
      consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy and/or medication. LIMITATIONS: The study 
      is retrospective and based on medical records which means there was no objective 
      measurement of the effectiveness of the therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-five percent 
      of patients improved after treatment independent of the kind of therapy, the 
      occurrence of comorbid disorders and the type of social phobia.

TI  - Social phobia: etiology, neurobiology, and treatment.
PG  - 25-35
AB  - Social phobia is a common and often disabling condition, with an etiology that is 
      not established. There is evidence at several levels for an interplay of biological 
      and psychological processes in social phobia. Genetic studies show that both genetic 
      and environmental factors are important, with evidence pointing to associations with 
      2 genetic conditions, autism and fragile X syndrome. Behavioral inhibition has 
      emerged as an important precursor to social phobia and possibly to other anxiety 
      disorders. Epidemiologic and clinical studies have suggested that factors within the 
      family environment, such as overprotection, overcontrol, modeling of anxiety, 
      criticism, and in some cases abuse, can play a role in the development of social 
      phobia. During childhood, complex interactions between brain system disturbances 
      that mediate responses to negative social cues and factors in the social setting may 
      lead to the development of a distorted set of internal "blueprints" for social 
      behavior. The impact of severe social anxiety on brain systems that mediate 
      behavioral change may prevent patients from learning better "blueprints." These can 
      be taught through cognitive-behavioral therapies. The effective control of social 
      anxiety with medications enables patients to recover; whether recovery can last 
      after discontinuation of medications may depend on whether a new "blueprint" has 
      been developed and whether stable changes in affected brain systems have occurred. 
      Neuroimaging techniques are at the early stage of identifying abnormalities at the 
      neurotransmitter and systems levels.

TI  - Treatment of borderline patients: a pragmatic approach.
PG  - 265-85
AB  - Outlined in the preceding sections are what one could call the ABCDs of treating 
      borderline patients. A = analytically informed psychotherapy; B = behavior therapy; 
      C = cognitive therapy; and D = drug therapy. Together they add up to "E": eclectic 
      therapy. In this pragmatic approach, the therapist will assess at the outset (1) 
      amenability to exploratory therapy, but also (2) the need for supportive measures, 
      including education, rehabilitation, and expansion of outside interests, (3) 
      indications for behavioral technics (socially alienating habits, handwashing 
      compulsions, phobias), (4) indications for cognitive measures (conflicts or fears 
      resolvable through rational explanation or logical weighing of alternatives), and 
      (5) indications for pharmacotherapy. All these steps involve the careful weighing of 
      biologic/constitutional, psychodynamic, and, where present, posttraumatic factors, 
      as well as personality assets and habitual problem-solving style. This will help 
      assure against overreliance on a technic that does not fit with the patient's 
      personality and against unwise persistence in a technic that is uncongenial or 
      threatening. Patients already in stable life situations who are seeking help because 
      of life crises may respond well to a brief course of therapy. Borderlines in late 
      adolescence or early adult life, if self-destructive and not yet able to form 
      lasting relationships (or to live contentedly without them), usually require 
      sustained treatment over several years, preferably with the same therapist. 
      Appropriate selection of medications, where indicated, should reduce impulsivity, 
      aggressivity, and psychoticism. This, in turn, will facilitate psychotherapeutic 
      work on maladaptive interpersonal patterns, exaggerated "all-or-none" responses to 
      relatively innocuous stimuli, overpersonalized responses to other people's remarks, 
      and so on. Therapists trained in identical methods will evaluate the same patient in 
      somewhat different ways owing to their differences in personality and perception. 
      This may lead to different sets of priorities and suggests different tactics that 
      are still within the realm of therapeutic efficacy. Those trained primarily in one 
      of the "ABCDs" may have equal success, yet via a different route than the one taken 
      by therapists of a different subspecialty. Borderline patients, perhaps two out of 
      five, often drop out of treatment no matter who the therapist. Yet two out of three 
      patients, if followed long enough, eventually have a good result. One therapist's 
      failure will be his colleague's success, and vice versa. Therapists, to maximize the 
      success of their own efforts, need to be sufficiently steeped in at least one 
      theoretical model of psychopathology/psychotherapy so as not to feel "lost" when 
      confronted by the often bewildering dynamics and symptoms of their borderline 
      patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Inpatient treatment of complicated agoraphobia and panic disorder.
PG  - 951-8
AB  - Despite recent advances in the treatment of agoraphobia and panic disorder, some 
      patients do not respond to standard outpatient regimens of biological and 
      psychosocial intervention and may require more intensive, closely supervised care. 
      The authors describe a specialized inpatient program that integrates 
      pharmacotherapy, intensive levels of exposure and other behavioral therapies, a 
      structured and strategically reinforcing environment, panic and anxiety management 
      strategies, and other interventions designed specifically for patients with 
      complicated panic-based disorders. Outcome data for 25 patients indicate that after 
      a mean stay of 35 days, 19 patients were significantly improved. These preliminary 
      results suggest that appropriately designed inpatient programs offer an effective 
      treatment option for some patients with refractory conditions of agoraphobia or 
      panic disorder.

TI  - Genetic variation in the endocannabinoid system and response to Cognitive Behavior 
      Therapy for child anxiety disorders.
PG  - 144-155
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32467 [doi]
AB  - Extinction learning is an important mechanism in the successful psychological 
      treatment of anxiety. Individual differences in response and relapse following 
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy may in part be explained by variability in the ease with 
      which fears are extinguished or the vulnerability of these fears to re-emerge. Given 
      the role of the endocannabinoid system in fear extinction, this study investigates 
      whether genetic variation in the endocannabinoid system explains individual 
      differences in response to CBT. Children (N = 1,309) with a primary anxiety disorder 
      diagnosis were recruited. We investigated the relationship between variation in the 
      CNR1, CNR2, and FAAH genes and change in primary anxiety disorder severity between 
      pre- and post-treatment and during the follow-up period in the full sample and a 
      subset with fear-based anxiety disorder diagnoses. Change in symptom severity during 
      active treatment was nominally associated (P < 0.05) with two SNPs. During the 
      follow-up period, five SNPs were nominally associated with a poorer treatment 
      response (rs806365 [CNR1]; rs2501431 [CNR2]; rs2070956 [CNR2]; rs7769940 [CNR1]; 
      rs2209172 [FAAH]) and one with a more favorable response (rs6928813 [CNR1]). Within 
      the fear-based subset, the effect of rs806365 survived multiple testing corrections 
      (P < 0.0016). We found very limited evidence for an association between variants in 
      endocannabinoid system genes and treatment response once multiple testing 
      corrections were applied. Larger, more homogenous cohorts are needed to allow the 
      identification of variants of small but statistically significant effect and to 
      estimate effect sizes for these variants with greater precision in order to 
      determine their potential clinical utility. © 2016 The Authors. American Journal of

TI  - "Fake it till You Make it"! Contaminating Rubber Hands ("Multisensory Stimulation 
      Therapy") to Treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
PG  - 414
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2019.00414 [doi]
LID - 414
AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a deeply enigmatic psychiatric condition 
      associated with immense suffering worldwide. Efficacious therapies for OCD, like 
      exposure and response prevention (ERP), are sometimes poorly tolerated by patients. 
      As many as 25% of patients refuse to initiate ERP mainly because they are too 
      anxious to follow exposure procedures. Accordingly, we proposed a simple and 
      tolerable (immersive yet indirect) low-cost technique for treating OCD that we call 
      "multisensory stimulation therapy." This method involves contaminating a rubber hand 
      during the so-called "rubber hand illusion" (RHI) in which tactile sensations may be 
      perceived as arising from a fake hand. Notably, Jalal et al. (2015) showed that such 
      fake hand contamination during the RHI provokes powerful disgust reactions in 
      healthy volunteers. In the current study, we explored the therapeutic potential of 
      this novel approach. OCD patients (n = 29) watched as their hidden real hand was 
      being stroked together with a visible fake hand; either synchronously (inducing the 
      RHI; i.e., the experimental condition; n = 16) or asynchronously (i.e., the control 
      condition; n = 13). After 5 min of tactile stimulation, the rubber hand was 
      contaminated with fake feces, simulating conventional exposure therapy. 
      Intriguingly, results suggested sensory assimilation of contamination sensations 
      into the body image via the RHI: patients undergoing synchronous stimulation did not 
      report greater contamination sensations when the fake hand was initially 
      contaminated relative to asynchronous stroking. But contrary to expectations, they 
      did so after the rubber hand had been contaminated for 5 min, as assessed via 
      disgust facial expressions (a secondary outcome) and in vivo exposure (upon 
      discontinuing the illusion). Further, to our surprise, synchronous and asynchronous 
      stroking induced an equally vivid and fast-emerging illusion, which helps explain 
      why both conditions initially (5 min after initiating tactile stimulation) provoked 
      contamination reactions of equal magnitude. This study is the first to suggest 
      heightened malleability of body image in OCD. Importantly, it may pave the way for a 
      tolerable technique for the treatment of OCD-highly suitable for poorly resourced 
      and emergency settings, including low-income and developing countries with minimal 
      access to high-tech solutions like virtual reality.

TI  - Family therapy approaches for anorexia nervosa.

LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004780.pub4 [doi]
LID - CD004780
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterised by a failure to maintain a normal 
      body weight due to a paucity of nutrition, an intense fear of gaining weight or 
      behaviour that prevents the individual from gaining weight, or both. The long-term 
      prognosis is often poor, with severe developmental, medical and psychosocial 
      complications, high rates of relapse and mortality. 'Family therapy approaches' 
      indicate a range of approaches, derived from different theories, that involve the 
      family in treatment. We have included therapies developed on the basis of dominant 
      family systems theories, approaches that are based on or broadly similar to the 
      family-based therapy derived from the Maudsley model, approaches that incorporate a 
      focus on cognitive restructuring, as well as approaches that involve the family 
      without articulation of a theoretical approach.This is an update of a Cochrane 
      Review first published in 2010. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of family 
      therapy approaches compared with standard treatment and other treatments for AN. 
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials 
      Register (CCMDCTR) and PsycINFO (OVID) (all years to April 2016). We ran additional 
      searches directly on Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
      MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 2008 and 2016 to 2018). We searched the World 
      Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov, together 
      with four theses databases (all years to 2018). We checked the reference lists of 
      all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have included in the 
      analyses only studies from searches conducted to April 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of family therapy approaches compared to any 
      other intervention or other types of family therapy approaches were eligible for 
      inclusion. We included participants of any age or gender with a primary clinical 
      diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors 
      selected the studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We used a random-effects 
      meta-analysis. We used the risk ratio (with a 95% confidence interval) to summarise 
      dichotomous outcomes and both the standardised mean difference and the mean 
      difference to summarise continuous measures. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 trials in 
      this version of the review (13 from the original 2010 review and 12 newly-included 
      studies). Sixteen trials were of adolescents, eight trials of adults (seven of these 
      in young adults aged up to 26 years) and one trial included three age groups: one 
      adolescent, one young adult and one adult. Most investigated family-based therapy or 
      variants. Reporting of trial conduct was generally inadequate, so that in a large 
      number of studies we rated the risk of bias as unclear for many of the domains. 
      Selective reporting bias was particularly problematic, with 68% of studies rated at 
      high risk of bias in this area, followed by incomplete outcome data, with 44% of 
      studies rated at high risk of bias in this area. For the main outcome measure of 
      remission there was some low-quality evidence (from only two studies, 81 
      participants) suggesting that family therapy approaches might offer some advantage 
      over treatment as usual on rates of remission, post intervention (risk ratio (RR) 
      3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 8.23; I(2) = 0%). However, at follow-up, 
      low-quality evidence from only one study suggested this effect was not maintained. 
      There was very low-quality evidence from only one trial, which means it is difficult 
      to determine whether family therapy approaches offer any advantage over educational 
      interventions for remission (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.53 to 153.79; 1 study, N = 30). 
      Similarly, there was very low-quality evidence from only five trials for remission 
      post-intervention, again meaning that it is difficult to determine whether there is 
      any advantage of family therapy approaches over psychological interventions (RR 
      1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; participants = 252; studies = 5; I(2) = 37%) and at 
      long-term follow-up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.28; participants = 200; studies = 4 
      with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I(2) = 
      0%). There was no indication that the age group had any impact on the overall 
      treatment effect; however, it should be noted that there were very few trials 
      undertaken in adults, with the age range of adult studies included in this analysis 
      from 20 to 27. There was some evidence of a small effect favouring family based 
      therapy compared with other psychological interventions in terms of weight gain 
      post-intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.63; 
      participants = 210; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons 
      for different age groups; I(2) = 11%) . Overall, there was insufficient evidence to 
      determine whether there were any differences between groups across all comparisons 
      for most of the secondary outcomes (weight, eating disorder psychopathology, 
      dropouts, relapse, or family functioning measures), either at post-intervention or 
      at follow-up. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a limited amount of low-quality 
      evidence to suggest that family therapy approaches may be effective compared to 
      treatment as usual in the short term. This finding is based on two trials that 
      included only a small number of participants, and both had issues about potential 
      bias. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is an advantage of 
      family therapy approaches in people of any age compared to educational interventions 
      (one study, very low quality) or other psychological therapies (five studies, very 
      low quality). Most studies contributing to this finding were undertaken in 
      adolescents and youth. There are clear potential impacts on how family therapy 
      approaches might be delivered to different age groups and further work is required 
      to understand what the resulting effects on treatment efficacy might be. There is 
      insufficient evidence to determine whether one type of family therapy approach is 
      more effective than another. The field would benefit from further large, 
      well-conducted trials.

AB  - Current medical countermeasures for organophosphate (OP)-induced status epilepticus 
      (SE) are not effective in preventing long-term morbidity and there is an urgent need 
      for improved therapies. Rat models of acute intoxication with the OP, 
      diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), are increasingly being used to evaluate 
      therapeutic candidates for efficacy in mitigating the long-term neurologic effects 
      associated with OP-induced SE. Many of these therapeutic candidates target 
      neuroinflammation and oxidative stress because of their implication in the 
      pathogenesis of persistent neurologic deficits associated with OP-induced SE. 
      Critical to these efforts is the rigorous characterization of the rat DFP model with 
      respect to outcomes associated with acute OP intoxication in humans, which include 
      long-term electroencephalographic, neurobehavioral, and neuropathologic effects, and 
      their temporal relationship to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. To address 
      these needs, we examined a range of outcomes at later times post-exposure than have 
      previously been reported for this model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given 
      pyridostigmine bromide (0.1 mg/kg, im) 30 min prior to administration of DFP 
      (4 mg/kg, sc), which was immediately followed by atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, im) and 
      pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, im). This exposure paradigm triggered robust 
      electroencephalographic and behavioral seizures that rapidly progressed to SE 
      lasting several hours in 90% of exposed animals. Animals that survived DFP-induced 
      SE (~70%) exhibited spontaneous recurrent seizures and hyperreactive responses to 
      tactile stimuli over the first 2 months post-exposure. Performance in the elevated 
      plus maze, open field, and Pavlovian fear conditioning tests indicated that acute 
      DFP intoxication reduced anxiety-like behavior and impaired learning and memory at 1 
      and 2 months post-exposure in the absence of effects on general locomotor behavior. 
      Immunohistochemical analyses revealed significantly increased expression of 
      biomarkers of reactive astrogliosis, microglial activation and oxidative stress in 
      multiple brain regions at 1 and 2 months post-DFP, although there was significant 
      spatiotemporal heterogeneity across these endpoints. Collectively, these data 
      largely support the relevance of the rat model of acute DFP intoxication as a model 
      for acute OP intoxication in the human, and support the hypothesis that 
      neuroinflammation and/or oxidative stress represent potential therapeutic targets 
      for mitigating the long-term neurologic sequelae of acute OP intoxication.

AB  - Similarities within the phenomenology, neurobiology, psychotherapeutic, and 
      pharmacological treatments of distinctly categorized anxiety and fear related 
      disorders suggest the involvement of common neurobiological mechanisms in their 
      formation. This theory of integration is the focus of the Research Domain Criteria 
      (RDoC) approach initiated by the NIH. The current article explores potential facets 
      of overlap among mainstream methods of psychotherapy for anxiety, fear, and trauma 
      related disorders. These overlaps include associative learning of safety, cognitive 
      reappraisal and emotion regulation, therapist as a social safety cue, and 
      contextualization. Temporal contextualization and placing memories in their time and 
      place will be suggested as a potentially important, and less explored aspect of 
      psychotherapy.

TI  - Comparing Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With Standard Care for Women 
      With Fear of Birth: Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e10420
LID - 10.2196/10420 [doi]
LID - e10420
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many pregnant women report fear related to the approaching 
      birth, no consensus exists on how fear of birth should be handled in clinical care. 
      OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy of a 
      guided internet-based self-help program based on cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (guided ICBT) with standard care on the levels of fear of birth in a sample of 
      pregnant women reporting fear of birth. METHODS: This nonblinded, multicenter 
      randomized controlled trial with a parallel design was conducted at three study 
      centers (hospitals) in Sweden. Recruitment commenced at the ultrasound screening 
      examination during gestational weeks 17-20. The therapist-guided ICBT intervention 
      was inspired by the Unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional 
      disorders and consisted of 8 treatment modules and 1 module for postpartum 
      follow-up. The aim was to help participants observe and understand their fear of 
      birth and find new ways of coping with difficult thoughts and emotions. Standard 
      care was offered in the three different study regions. The primary outcome was 
      self-assessed levels of fear of birth, measured using the Fear of Birth Scale. 
      RESULTS: We included 258 pregnant women reporting clinically significant levels of 
      fear of birth (guided ICBT group, 127; standard care group, 131). Of the 127 women 
      randomized to the guided ICBT group, 103 (81%) commenced treatment, 60 (47%) moved 
      on to the second module, and only 13 (10%) finished ≥4 modules. The levels of fear 
      of birth did not differ between the intervention groups postintervention. At 1-year 
      postpartum follow-up, participants in the guided ICBT group exhibited significantly 
      lower levels of fear of birth (U=3674.00, z=-1.97, P=.049, Cohen d=0.28, 95% CI 
      -0.01 to 0.57). Using the linear mixed models analysis, an overall decrease in the 
      levels of fear of birth over time was found (P≤ .001), along with a significant 
      interaction between time and intervention, showing a larger reduction in fear of 
      birth in the guided ICBT group over time (F(1,192.538)=4.96, P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Fear of birth decreased over time in both intervention groups; while the decrease 
      was slightly larger in the guided ICBT group, the main effect of time alone, 
      regardless of treatment allocation, was most evident. Poor treatment adherence to 
      guided ICBT implies low feasibility and acceptance of this treatment. TRIAL

TI  - Psychiatry, Cultural Competency, and the Care of Ultra-Orthodox Jews: Achieving 
      Secular and Theocentric Convergence Through Introspection.
PG  - 1702-1716
LID - 10.1007/s10943-018-0678-z [doi]
AB  - Several socio-cultural factors complicate mental health care in the ultra-Orthodox 
      Jewish population. These include societal stigma, fear of the influence of secular 
      ideas, the need for rabbinic approval of the method and provider, and the notion 
      that excessive concern with the self is counter-productive to religious growth. 
      Little is known about how the religious beliefs of this population might be employed 
      in therapeutic contexts. One potential point of convergence is the Jewish 
      philosophical tradition of introspection as a means toward personal, interpersonal, 
      and spiritual growth. We reviewed Jewish religious-philosophical writings on 
      introspection from antiquity (the Babylonian Talmud) to the Middle Ages (Duties of 
      the Heart), the eighteenth century (Path of the Just), the early Hasidic movement 
      (the Tanya), and modernity (Alei Shur, Halakhic Man). Analysis of these texts 
      indicates that: (1) introspection can be a religiously acceptable reaction to 
      existential distress; (2) introspection might promote alignment of religious beliefs 
      with emotions, intellect and behavior; (3) some religious philosophers were 
      concerned about the demotivating effects of excessive introspection and 
      self-critique on religious devotion and emotional well-being; (4) certain religious 
      forms of introspection are remarkably analogous to modern methods of psychiatry and 
      psychology, particularly psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy. We conclude that homology between religious philosophy of emotion and 
      secular methods of psychiatry and psychotherapy may inform the choice and method of 
      mental health care, foster the therapist-patient relationship, and thereby enable 
      therapeutic convergence.

TI  - Phencyclidine and Scopolamine for Modeling Amnesia in Rodents: Direct Comparison 
      with the Use of Barnes Maze Test and Contextual Fear Conditioning Test in Mice.
PG  - 431-441

AB  - Nowadays cognitive impairments are a growing unresolved medical issue which may 
      accompany many diseases and therapies, furthermore, numerous researchers investigate 
      various neurobiological aspects of human memory to find possible ways to improve it. 
      Until any other method is discovered, in vivo studies remain the only available tool 
      for memory evaluation. At first, researchers need to choose a model of amnesia which 
      may strongly influence observed results. Thereby a deeper insight into a model 
      itself may increase the quality and reliability of results. The most common method 
      to impair memory in rodents is the pretreatment with drugs that disrupt learning and 
      memory. Taking this into consideration, we compared the activity of agents commonly 
      used for this purpose. We investigated effects of phencyclidine (PCP), a 
      non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, and scopolamine (SCOP), an antagonist of 
      muscarinic receptors, on short-term spatial memory and classical fear conditioning 
      in mice. PCP (3 mg/kg) and SCOP (1 mg/kg) were administrated intraperitoneally 
      30 min before behavioral paradigms. To assess the influence of PCP and SCOP on 
      short-term spatial memory, the Barnes maze test in C57BL/J6 mice was used. Effects 
      on classical conditioning were evaluated using contextual fear conditioning test. 
      Additionally, spontaneous locomotor activity of mice was measured. These two tests 
      were performed in CD-1 mice. Our study reports that both tested agents disturbed 
      short-term spatial memory in the Barnes maze test, however, SCOP revealed a higher 
      activity. Surprisingly, learning in contextual fear conditioning test was impaired 
      only by SCOP. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.

TI  - Feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of playing Nintendo Wii 
      Fit Plus™ for frail elderly: study protocol for a feasibility trial.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1186/s40814-017-0184-1 [doi]
LID - 41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty can be defined as a medical syndrome with multiple causes and 
      contributors, characterized by diminished strength and endurance and reduced 
      physiological function that increases the vulnerability to develop functional 
      dependency and/or death. Studies have shown that the most commonly studied exercise 
      protocol for frail older adults is the multimodal training. Interactive video games 
      (IVGs) involve tasks in virtual environments that combine physical and cognitive 
      demands in an attractive and challenging way. The aim of this study will be to 
      evaluate the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of playing 
      Nintendo Wii Fit Plus(TM) (NWFP) for frail older adults. METHODS/DESIGN: The study 
      is a randomized controlled, parallel group, feasibility trial. Participants will be 
      randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) and control group (CG). The EG will 
      participate in 14 training sessions, each lasting 50 min, twice a week. In each 
      training session, the participants will play five games, with three attempts at each 
      game. The first attempt will be performed with the assistance of a physical 
      therapist to correct the movements and posture of the patients and subsequent 
      attempts will be performed independently. Scores achieved in the games will be 
      recorded. The participants will be evaluated by a blinded physical therapist at 
      three moments: before and after intervention and 30 days after the end of the 
      intervention (follow-up). We will assess the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and 
      clinical outcomes (postural control, gait, cognition, quality of life, mood, and 
      fear of falling). DISCUSSION: Due to the deficiencies in multiple systems, studies 
      have shown that multimodal interventions including motor-cognitive stimulation can 
      improve the mobility of frail elderly adults. IVGs, among them the NWFP, are 
      considered as a multimodal motor-cognitive intervention that can potentially improve 
      motor and cognitive functions in the frail elderly. However, there is still no 
      evidence in the literature that proves the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and 
      functional outcomes of this intervention in frail elderly individuals. TRIAL

TI  - Psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with 
      or without agoraphobia in adults.
PG  - CD011170
LID - CD011170
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well-being. 
      Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as 
      treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no 
      up-to-date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two 
      treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning 
      for this disorder. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of 
      psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, 
      with or without agoraphobia, in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane 
      Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This 
      register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase 
      (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross-checked reference lists 
      of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on 
      date, language, or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all 
      randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological 
      interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by 
      operationalised criteria in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors 
      independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a 
      third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean 
      differences (with 95% CI). We used the random-effects model throughout. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present 
      review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the 
      Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia.None of the studies reported long-term 
      remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment 
      commencement).There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies 
      and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short-term remission 
      (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short-term response 
      (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low-quality 
      evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs 
      in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% 
      CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low-quality evidence).There was no 
      evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic 
      antidepressants in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 
      studies; 229 participants), short-term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 
      studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 
      1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low-quality evidence).There was no evidence of a 
      difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of 
      short-term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; 
      very low-quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not 
      significantly increase or decrease the short-term response over other 
      antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or 
      dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) 
      (low-quality evidence).There was no evidence of a difference between psychological 
      therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short-term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 
      to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short-term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 
      3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 
      to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low-quality evidence).There was no 
      evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant 
      alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short-term remission (RR 
      0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short-term response (RR 
      0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low-quality evidence), and 
      there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either 
      antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment 
      acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 
      13 studies; 909 participants; very low-quality evidence). The risk of selection bias 
      and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses 
      limited to trials with longer-term, quality-controlled, or individual psychological 
      therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological 
      therapies for some outcomes.There were no data to contribute to a comparison between 
      psychological therapies and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and 
      subsequent adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence in this review was 
      often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due 
      to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short-term efficacy 
      and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse 
      effects.The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity 
      indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological 
      therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological 
      therapies.Future studies should examine the long-term effects after intervention or 
      treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially 
      with regard to selection and reporting biases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persecutory delusions (strong unfounded fears that others intend harm to 
      the person) occur in more than 70 % of the patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
      This major psychotic experience is a key clinical target, for which substantial 
      improvement in treatment is needed. Our aim is to use advances in theoretical 
      understanding to develop a much more efficacious treatment that leads to recovery in 
      at least 50 % of people with persistent persecutory delusions. Our cognitive 
      conceptualisation is that persecutory delusions are threat beliefs, developed in the 
      context of genetic and environmental risk, maintained by a number of psychological 
      processes including excessive worry, low self-confidence, intolerance of anxious 
      affect and other internal anomalous experiences, reasoning biases, and 
      safety-seeking strategies. The clinical implication is that safety has to be 
      relearned, by entering the feared situations after reduction of the influence of the 
      maintenance factors. We have been individually evaluating modules targeting causal 
      factors. These will now be tested together as a full treatment, called The Feeling 
      Safe Programme. The treatment is modular, personalised, and includes patient 
      preference. We will test whether the new treatment leads to greater recovery in 
      persistent persecutory delusions, psychological well-being, and activity levels 
      compared to befriending (that is, controlling for therapist attention). 
      METHODS/DESIGN: The Feeling Safe Study is a parallel group randomised controlled 
      trial for 150 patients who have persecutory delusions despite previous treatment in 
      mental health services. Patients will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to The Feeling Safe 
      Programme or befriending (both provided in 20 sessions over 6 months). Standard care 
      will continue as usual. Online randomisation will use a permuted blocks algorithm, 
      with randomly varying block size, stratified by therapist. Assessments, by a rater 
      blind to allocation, will be conducted at 0, 6 (post treatment), and 12 months. The 
      primary outcome is the level of delusional conviction at 6 months. Secondary 
      outcomes include levels of psychological well-being, suicidal ideation, and 
      activity. All main analyses will be intention-to-treat. The trial is funded by the 
      NHS National Institute for Health Research. DISCUSSION: The Feeling Safe study will 
      provide a Phase II evaluation of a new targeted translational psychological 
      treatment for persecutory delusions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials 
      ISRCTN18705064 (registered 11 November 2015).

AB  - Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a structured outpatient treatment developed by 
      Dr Marsha Linehan for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD). 
      Dialectical behavior therapy is based on cognitive-behavioral principles and is 
      currently the only empirically supported treatment for BPD. Randomized controlled 
      trials have shown the efficacy of DBT not only in BPD but also in other psychiatric 
      disorders, such as substance use disorders, mood disorders, posttraumatic stress 
      disorder, and eating disorders. Traditional DBT is structured into 4 components, 
      including skills training group, individual psychotherapy, telephone consultation, 
      and therapist consultation team. These components work together to teach behavioral 
      skills that target common symptoms of BPD, including an unstable sense of self, 
      chaotic relationships, fear of abandonment, emotional lability, and impulsivity such 
      as self-injurious behaviors. The skills include mindfulness, interpersonal 
      effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance. Given the often comorbid 
      psychiatric symptoms with BPD in patients participating in DBT, psychopharmacologic 
      interventions are oftentimes considered appropriate adjunctive care. This article 
      aims to outline the basic principles of DBT as well as comment on the role of 
      pharmacotherapy as adjunctive treatment for the symptoms of BPD.

TI  - Hippocampus-dependent cognitive enhancement induced by systemic gintonin 
      administration.
PG  - 55-61
LID - 10.1016/j.jgr.2015.05.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases share impaired 
      cognition as a common symptom. Therefore, the development of clinically applicable 
      therapies to enhance cognition has yielded significant interest. Previously, we have 
      shown that activation of lysophosphatidic acid receptors (LPARs) via gintonin 
      application potentiates synaptic transmission by the blockade of K(+) channels in 
      the mature hippocampus. However, whether gintonin may exert any beneficial impact 
      directly on cognition at the neural circuitry level and the behavioral level has not 
      been investigated. METHODS: In the current study, we took advantage of gintonin, a 
      novel LPAR agonist, to investigate the effect of gintonin-mediated LPAR activation 
      on cognitive performances. Hippocampus-dependent fear memory test, synaptic 
      plasticity in the hippocampal brain slices, and quantitative analysis on synaptic 
      plasticity-related proteins were used. RESULTS: Daily oral administration of 
      gintonin for 1 wk significantly improved fear memory retention in the contextual 
      fear-conditioning test in mice. We also found that oral administration of gintonin 
      for 1 wk increased the expression of learning and memory-related proteins such as 
      phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding (CREB) 
      protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In addition, prolonged 
      gintonin administration enhanced long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. 
      CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that the systemic gintonin administration could 
      successfully improve contextual memory formation at the molecular and synaptic 
      levels as well as the behavioral level. Therefore, oral administration of gintonin 
      may serve as an effective noninvasive, nonsurgical method of enhancing cognitive 
      functions.

AB  - This pilot study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and potential 
      effectiveness of delivering an intensive weekend group treatment for panic disorder 
      (PD) to Veterans returning from deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan with 
      co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The treatment program lasted 6h 
      each day and was delivered by two experienced therapists. Patients received core 
      components of panic treatment, including psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, 
      and interoceptive exposure. The interoceptive exposure exercises directly targeted 
      anxiety sensitivity, a psychological construct also implicated in the maintenance of 
      PTSD. Eighty-nine percent of patients who expressed interest in the treatment 
      attended a baseline evaluation, and 63% of those who were study eligible initiated 
      treatment. Treatment retention was high, with all 10 patients who initiated 
      treatment completing the program. Veterans reported finding the treatment and 
      delivery format highly acceptable and reported high levels of satisfaction. Panic 
      symptoms improved significantly following the treatment and were maintained at a 
      7-month follow-up, with 71.4% of the sample reporting being panic free. Co-occurring 
      PTSD symptoms also improved along with symptoms of anxiety and depression. 
      Preliminary findings suggest that brief and intensive group treatments for PD/PTSD 
      are a promising method of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy that may rapidly 
      improve symptoms. This innovative treatment delivery format also may be a 
      cost-effective way of increasing treatment engagement through increased access to 
      quality care.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric illness whose prevalence in 
      women is more than twice the rate as men. Despite a burgeoning literature 
      characterizing sex differences in PTSD incidence and its disproportionate burden on 
      society, there is a dearth of literature describing biological mechanisms underlying 
      these disparities. However, the recent identification of biomarkers of PTSD by 
      translational neuroscientists offers a promising opportunity to explore sex 
      interactions in PTSD phenotypes. A notable observation is that individuals with PTSD 
      show deficits in their ability to inhibit conditioned fear responding after 
      extinction training. Given that extinction procedures, via exposure-based cognitive 
      behavioral therapy, make up one of the predominant modes of treatment in PTSD, there 
      is a critical need for more research on sex interactions in this form of fear 
      regulation. An emerging hypothesis is that fluctuating gonadal hormones, especially 
      estrogen, in the menstrual cycle may play a critical role in fear extinction and, 
      hence, PTSD vulnerability and symptom severity in women. The current review 
      discusses how the study of putative activational effects of estrogen on fear 
      extinction may be harnessed to advance the search for better treatments for PTSD in 
      women. We conclude that estrogen treatment may be a putative pharmacologic adjunct 
      in extinction-based therapies and should be tracked in the menstrual cycle during 
      the course of PTSD treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Schemas represent a stable vision of oneself. Young's schema 
      questionnaire-s3 (YSQ-s3) presents 90 perceptions of oneself, specifying 18 early 
      maladaptive schemas (EMS). We studied the intensity and inter-relations of these 18 
      EMS and how they pool together into a specific domain. METHOD: Two hundred and 
      ninety four subjects (294 patients from a French private practice in psychiatry and 
      12 volunteers) filled in a French version of the YSQ-s3. Item scores range from 1 to 
      6. Only the scores of 4 "true for me during most of my life" or higher were kept for 
      the statistical analysis. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, 
      principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). 
      RESULTS: The EMS mean scores ranged from 3.4 to 12.9 and standard deviations from 
      5.9 to 9.7. EMS score correlations range from 0.009 to 0.55. The principal component 
      analysis (PCA), that provides linear combinations of each EMS score, yields only one 
      meaningful component. Indeed, the screen plot that provides the eigen values 
      associated with each principal component, suggests keeping only the first component. 
      This component presents a size-effect and represents the "global scores intensity". 
      The hierarchical clustering analysis (HC) fits the 18 EMS in 5 domains (r(2) = 0.4): 
      (1) "avoidance" (with 3 EMS: emotional deprivation, social isolation/alienation, 
      emotional inhibition), (2)"give" (with 1 EMS: self-sacrifice), (3) "take" (with 3 
      EMS: entitlement/grandiosity, insufficient self-control/self-discipline, 
      approval-seeking/recognition-seeking) (4) "awareness" (with 8 EMS: 
      abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, defectiveness/shame, 
      dependence/incompetence, vulnerability to harm or illness, enmeshment/undeveloped 
      self, failure, subjugation) (5) "faith" (with 3 EMS: negativity/pessimism, 
      unrelenting standards/hyper-criticalness, punitiveness). When the HC analysis is 
      applied to the population (n = 294), it yields 6 classes of patients. The mean score 
      of the 5 domains, described above, can describe these classes. DISCUSSION: These 5 
      domains do not completely fit Young's five "primary infantile needs" domains. Only 
      2/3 of the EMS are correctly attributed to the "primary infantile needs" domains. 
      The 5 domains seem closely related to the 5 dimensions of the NEO-PI-R or to the 5 
      domains of personality disorders (criteria b) described in the DSM-5. In our 
      understanding the dimensions "avoidance, give, take" represent 3 types of 
      relationship to others (on behavioral level). The dimension "awareness" represents 
      the fears and losses (on the emotional level) and "faith" represents beliefs and 
      consciousness (on the cognitive level). The intensity of the 5 domains inside each 
      class of patients could guide the clinical interpretation, specifically for 
      personality disorders.

TI  - Do therapeutic imagery practices affect physiological and emotional indicators of 
      threat in high self-critics?
PG  - 270-84
LID - 10.1111/papt.12043 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Imagery is known to be a powerful means of stimulating various 
      physiological processes and is increasingly used within standard psychological 
      therapies. Compassion-focused imagery (CFI) has been used to stimulate affiliative 
      emotion in people with mental health problems. However, evidence suggests that 
      self-critical individuals may have particular difficulties in this domain with 
      single trials. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the role of 
      self-criticism in responsiveness to CFI by specifically pre-selecting participants 
      based on trait self-criticism. DESIGN: Using the Forms of 
      Self-Criticism/Self-Reassuring Scale, 29 individuals from a total sample of 139 were 
      pre-selected to determine how self-criticism impacts upon an initial instance of 
      imagery. METHODS: All participants took part in three activities: a control imagery 
      intervention (useable data N = 25), a standard CFI intervention (useable data N = 
      25), and a non-intervention control (useable data N = 24). Physiological 
      measurements (alpha amylase) as well as questionnaire measures of emotional 
      responding (i.e., the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Types of Positive 
      Affect Scale, and the State Adult Attachment Scale) were taken before and after the 
      different interventions. RESULTS: Following both imagery interventions, repeated 
      measures analyses revealed that alpha amylase increased significantly for high 
      self-critics compared with low self-critics. High self-critics (HSC) also reported 
      greater insecurity on entering the imagery session and more negative CFI experiences 
      compared with low self-critics. CONCLUSIONS: Data demonstrate that HSC respond 
      negatively to imagery interventions in a single trial. This highlights that imagery 
      focused therapies (e.g., CFI) need interventions that manage fears, blocks, and 
      resistances to the techniques, particularly in HSC. PRACTITIONER POINTS: An initial 
      instance of imagery (e.g., CFI) can be frightening for people who have a tendency to 
      be self-critical. This research provides examples of physiological and emotional 
      responses to imagery type therapies in high and low self-critics, and associated 
      clinical implications. Therapists may find it helpful to be mindful that when 
      introducing imagery based therapies, highly self-critical patients need 
      interventions that manage fears, blocks, and resistances to the techniques.

TI  - Coadministration of hydrogen gas as part of the carrier gas mixture suppresses 
      neuronal apoptosis and subsequent behavioral deficits caused by neonatal exposure to 
      sevoflurane in mice.
PG  - 105-13
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0b013e318275146d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In animal models, several anesthetics induce widespread increases in 
      neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain with subsequent neurologic deficits. 
      Although the mechanisms are largely unknown, the neurotoxicity may, at least in 
      part, be due to elevated oxidative stress caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. In an 
      investigation of potential therapies that could protect against this type of damage, 
      we studied the effects of molecular hydrogen on anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in 
      the developing mouse brain. METHODS: Six-day-old C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 3% 
      sevoflurane for 6 h with or without hydrogen (< 1.3%) as part of the carrier gas 
      mixture. Apoptosis was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for cleaved 
      caspase-3 (n = 8-10/group). Western blot analysis for cleaved poly-(adenosine 
      diphosphate-ribose) polymerase was also performed to examine apoptosis (n = 
      3-6/group). Oxidative stress was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for 
      4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (n = 8/group). Long-term memory and social behavior were 
      examined using the fear conditioning test and the sociability test, respectively (n 
      = 18-20/group). RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed that coadministration of 1.3% 
      hydrogen gas significantly (P < 0.001) reduced the level of neuronal apoptosis to 
      approximately 40% compared with sevoflurane exposure alone. Immunohistochemical 
      analysis showed that hydrogen reduced oxidative stress induced by neonatal 
      sevoflurane exposure. Although neonatal sevoflurane exposure caused impairment in 
      long-term memory and abnormal social behaviors in adulthood, mice coadministered 
      hydrogen gas with sevoflurane did not exhibit these deficits. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Inhalation of hydrogen gas robustly decreased neuronal apoptosis and subsequent 
      cognitive impairments caused by neonatal exposure to sevoflurane.

      (CME multimedia activity).

LID - 10.1016/j.amjmed.2011.10.004 [doi]
AB  - As shown in this CME online activity (www.cmeaccess.com/AJM/ChronicPain02), chronic, 
      non-cancer pain can arise from a variety of etiologies and can be broadly classified 
      based on its underlying mechanism as nociceptive, inflammatory, neuropathic, or 
      central, with some patients having pain arising from a combination of mechanisms. 
      Chronic pain assessment and treatment involves evaluating not only its biological 
      aspects, but also psychological and sociocultural factors. Beyond neural mechanisms, 
      a patient's perception of chronic pain can be influenced by comorbid mood disorders, 
      such as depression and anxiety; cognitive and affective traits, such as 
      catastrophizing and fear-avoidance; environmental stressors, family relationships, 
      social support, and cultural beliefs. Based on this biopsychosocial model, a 
      multidisciplinary approach to management incorporates pharmacotherapy (opioid, 
      nonopioid, and centrally-acting analgesics, and pain adjuvant medications) with 
      nonpharmacologic physical rehabilitation and psychological and behavioral therapies 
      to address the multifactorial causes of chronic pain, which in turn leads to 
      improvement of physical and psychological function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine a large sample of patients with anxiety and the association 
      between types of complementary and alternative treatments that were used, 
      demographic variables, diagnostic categories, and treatment outcomes. METHOD: 
      Cross-sectional and longitudinal survey during the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and 
      Management (CALM) study that assessed this intervention against the Usual Care in a 
      sample of patients with anxiety recruited from primary care. 
      Interviewer-administered questionnaires via a centralized telephone survey by 
      blinded assessment raters. The interviews were done at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 
      months of the study. A total of 1004 adults ages 18-75 who met DSM-IV criteria for 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, or 
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. We assessed medication/herbal use, the use of any 
      alternative therapies, and combined Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) 
      use. RESULTS: We found an extensive (43%) use of a variety of CAM treatments that is 
      consistent with previous study results in populations with anxiety. Only a few 
      significant demographic or interventional characteristics of CAM users were found. 
      Users most often had a diagnosis of GAD, were older, more educated, and had two or 
      more chronic medical conditions. CAM users who had a 50% or more drop in anxiety 
      scores over 18 months were less likely to report continued use of alternative 
      therapies. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the importance of awareness of CAM use in 
      this population for possible interference with traditional first-line treatments of 
      these disorders, but also for finding the best integrative use for patients who 
      require multiple treatment modalities.

      (CBASP). Patients are asked to name up to six significant others and answer two 
      questions: (1) What was it like growing up with or being around this person? (2) 
      What is the emotional "stamp" you take from this relationship that informs who you 
      are today? An interpersonal-emotional theme reflecting the early learning history of 
      the patient is derived from these "stamps" or causal theory conclusions. One 
      transference hypothesis (TH) is derived from the Significant Other History (SOH) and 
      is formulated in one sentence, such as "If I do this, then the therapist will likely 
      do that" (e.g., "If I make a mistake around Dr. E, then Dr. E will label me 'stupid' 
      or 'incompetent"). The transference hypothesis highlights the interpersonal content 
      that most likely informs the patient's expectancy of the therapist's reactions 
      toward him or her. Throughout the therapy process, the therapist will proactively 
      employ the transference hypothesis in a technique known as the Interpersonal 
      Discrimination Exercise to help patients cognitively and emotionally discriminate 
      the practitioner from hurtful significant others. The goal here is to increase the 
      patient's felt safety within the therapeutic dyad and eventually to generalize the 
      felt safety to the patient's other relationships.

AB  - Opioid-related deaths in the United States have become a public health problem, with 
      accidental and unintended overdoses being especially troubling. Screening for 
      psychological risk factors is an important first step in safeguarding against 
      nonadherence practices and identifying patients who may be vulnerable to the risks 
      associated with opioid therapy. Validated screening instruments can aid in this 
      attempt as a complementary tool to clinicians' assessments. A structured screening 
      is imperative as part of an assessment, as clinician judgment is not the most 
      reliable method of identifying nonadherence. As a complement to formal screening, we 
      present for discussion and possible future study certain psychological variables 
      observed during years of clinical practice that may be linked to medication 
      nonadherence and accidental overdose. These variables include catastrophizing, fear, 
      impulsivity, attention deficit disorders, existential distress, and certain 
      personality disorders. In our experience, chronic pain patients with dual diagnoses 
      may become "chemical copers" as a way of coping with their negative emotion. For 
      these patients, times of stress could lead to accidental overdose. Behavioral, 
      cognitive-behavioral (acceptance and commitment, dialectical behavior), existential 
      (meaning-centered, dignity), and psychotropic therapies have been effective in 
      treating these high-risk comorbidities, while managing expectations of pain relief 
      appears key to preventing accidental overdose.

PG  - 615-25
LID - 10.1517/14656566.2011.534983 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common psychiatric 
      disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of 5-12%. Fears of scrutiny and embarrassment 
      in social and public situations are accompanied by anxiety symptoms, avoidance 
      behavior, and impairment in social and work functioning. Several classes of 
      medication, as well as cognitive-behavioral therapies, have evidence for efficacy in 
      the treatment of SAD, but only a minority of individuals with the disorder receives 
      treatment. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the evidence-based treatment of SAD 
      with medications including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine 
      reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, other antidepressants, 
      benzodiazepines, alpha-delta calcium-channel agents, and beta-adrenergic blockers. 
      It discusses clinical considerations in the selection and monitoring of treatments, 
      including issues of safety, duration of treatment, comorbidity, and integration of 
      medication with psychotherapeutic treatment. For this review, a PubMed literature 
      search was conducted during July, 2010. EXPERT OPINION: Medications in several 
      classes have been demonstrated efficacious in the treatment of SAD. Treatment 
      selection and implementation require attention to clinical diagnosis, patient 
      education, and appropriate monitoring.

TI  - Salient components of a comprehensive service for eating disorders.
PG  - 150-5
AB  - Eating disorders are challenging and difficult to treat, because of the necessity of 
      a multidisciplinary treatment team for effective outcomes and the high mortality 
      rate of anorexia nervosa. An adequate initial assessment and evaluation requires a 
      psychiatric assessment, a medical history and medical examination, a social history 
      and an interview of family members or collateral informants. A comprehensive eating 
      disorder treatment team includes a psychiatrist coordinating the treatment and 
      appropriate medical physician specialists, nutritionists, and psychotherapists. An 
      adequate outpatient eating disorder clinic needs to provide individual psychotherapy 
      with cognitive behavioral techniques specific for anorexia nervosa and bulimia 
      nervosa, family therapy, pharmacological treatment and the resources to obtain 
      appropriate laboratory tests. Eating disorder patients requiring inpatient care are 
      best treated in a specialized eating disorder inpatient unit. A cognitive behavioral 
      framework is most useful for the overall unit milieu. Medical management and 
      nutritional rehabilitation are the primary goals for inpatient treatment. Various 
      group therapies can cover common core eating disorder psychopathology problems and 
      dialectical behavior therapy groups can be useful for managing emotional 
      dysregulation. Residential, partial hospitalization and day treatment programs are 
      useful for transitioning patients from an inpatient program or for patients needing 
      some monitoring. In these programs, at least one structured meal is advisable as 
      well as nutritional counseling, group therapy or individual counseling sessions. 
      Group therapies usually address issues such as social skills training, social 
      anxiety, body image distortion or maturity fears. Unfortunately there is s paucity 
      of evidence based randomized control trials to recommend the salient components for 
      a comprehensive service for eating disorders. Experienced eating disorder clinicians 
      have come to the conclusion that a multidisciplinary team approach provides the most 
      effective treatment.

TI  - Preventing panic disorder: cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pragmatic 
      randomised trial.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1186/1478-7547-7-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder affects many people, is associated with a formidable 
      disease burden, and imposes costs on society. The annual influx of new cases of 
      panic disorder is substantial. From the public health perspective it may therefore 
      be a sound policy to reduce the influx of new cases, to maintain the quality of life 
      in many people, and to avoid the economic costs associated with the full-blown 
      disorder. For this purpose, prevention is needed. Here we present the first economic 
      evaluation of such an intervention. METHODS: Randomised trial of 117 people with 
      panic disorder symptoms not meeting the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV panic 
      disorder. The interventions were time-limited cognitive-behavioural therapy v 
      care-as-usual. The central clinical endpoint was DSM-IV panic disorder-free survival 
      over 3 months. Costs were calculated from the societal perspective. Using the 
      bootstrap method, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were obtained, placed in 95% 
      confidence intervals, projected on the cost-effectiveness plane, and presented as 
      acceptability curves. RESULTS: The median incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is 
      euro6,198 (95% CI 2,435 - 60,731) per PD-free survival gained, which has a 
      likelihood of 75.2% of being more acceptable from a cost-effectiveness point of view 
      than care-as-usual when a willingness-to-pay ceiling is assumed of euro10,000 per 
      PD-free survival. The most significant cost driver was therapists' time. A 
      sensitivity analysis indicated that cost-effectiveness improves when the number of 
      therapist hours is reduced. CONCLUSION: This is the first economic evaluation 
      alongside a prevention trial in panic disorder. The small sample (n = 117) and the 
      short time horizon of 3 months preclude firm conclusions, but our findings suggest 
      that the intervention may be acceptable from a cost-effectiveness point of view, 
      especially when therapist involvement can be kept minimal. Nevertheless, our results 
      must await replication in a larger trial with longer follow-up times before we can 
      confidently recommend implementation of the intervention on a broad scale. In the 
      light of our findings and given the burden of panic disorder, such a new trial is 
      well worth the effort.

TI  - New developments in the treatment of epilepsy.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Epilepsy is a medical disorder that presents with single or clustered seizures. 
      There are several new drugs that effectively treat epilepsy with few side effects, 
      and treatments of children, women, and the elderly are discussed. In the special 
      population of children, there is a strong emphasis on the cognitive and behavioral 
      benefits of specific therapies. In the population of epileptic women, seizures most 
      often occur at the start of puberty and menarche, and worsen periodically with each 
      menstrual cycle. Relief of symptoms often occurs at menopause, but a possibility of 
      exacerbation also exists. Women with epilepsy often battle a fear of becoming 
      pregnant. This is a fallacy which must be widely dispelled, as the risk is less than 
      supposed. Among the elderly, epilepsy often presents after trauma, particularly 
      stroke, and the incidence is three times greater for those over 60 years of age than 
      the general population. Due to various conditions specific to the elderly, 
      misdiagnosis is common. The greatest challenge in treating the elderly is adverse 
      side effects.

TI  - An animal model of emotional blunting in schizophrenia.
PG  - e1360
LID - e1360
AB  - Schizophrenia is often associated with emotional blunting--the diminished ability to 
      respond to emotionally salient stimuli--particularly those stimuli representative of 
      negative emotional states, such as fear. This disturbance may stem from dysfunction 
      of the amygdala, a brain region involved in fear processing. The present article 
      describes a novel animal model of emotional blunting in schizophrenia. This model 
      involves interfering with normal fear processing (classical conditioning) in rats by 
      means of acute ketamine administration. We confirm, in a series of experiments 
      comprised of cFos staining, behavioral analysis and neurochemical determinations, 
      that ketamine interferes with the behavioral expression of fear and with normal fear 
      processing in the amygdala and related brain regions. We further show that the 
      atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine, but not the typical antipsychotic haloperidol 
      nor an experimental glutamate receptor 2/3 agonist, inhibits ketamine's effects and 
      retains normal fear processing in the amygdala at a neurochemical level, despite the 
      observation that fear-related behavior is still inhibited due to ketamine 
      administration. Our results suggest that the relative resistance of emotional 
      blunting to drug treatment may be partially due to an inability of conventional 
      therapies to target the multiple anatomical and functional brain systems involved in 
      emotional processing. A conceptual model reconciling our findings in terms of 
      neurochemistry and behavior is postulated and discussed.

TI  - Rater bias in a blinded randomized placebo-controlled psychiatry trial.
PG  - 2762-70
AB  - Rater bias occurs when rater knowledge of treatment assignment modifies the outcome 
      assessment. Raters may be unconsciously influenced by inclinations for or against a 
      particular treatment and consequently may give a more or less generous assessment 
      depending upon these biases. Blinding of raters by keeping raters unaware of 
      treatment assignment is one way to limit bias influencing assessment due to 
      knowledge of treatment assignment. Unblinding may be particularly problematic in 
      efficacy studies comparing placebo to drugs and/or non-drug psychotherapy treatments 
      where subjects may reveal drug side-effects or mention their therapist by name, thus 
      unblinding their treatment assignment. We present a new instrumental variable 
      statistical approach for assessing the association between success in blinding and 
      its impact on efficacy estimates of active drug and/or cognitive behavioural 
      psychotherapy versus placebo in the multicentre comparative treatment study of panic 
      disorder. Despite the uncertainty involved in assessing bias that may be unobserved 
      and unconscious, we will show how to derive a bound for the impact of rater bias.

TI  - Treatment of panic disorder.
PG  - 733-9
AB  - Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia occurs commonly in patients in primary 
      care settings. This article assesses multiple evidence-based reviews of effective 
      treatments for panic disorder. Antidepressant medications successfully reduce the 
      severity of panic symptoms and eliminate panic attacks. Selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective in the treatment of 
      panic disorder. The choice of medication is based on side effect profiles and 
      patient preferences. Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of cognitive 
      behavior therapy in treating panic disorder. Family physicians who are not trained 
      in cognitive behavior therapy may refer patients with panic disorder to therapists 
      with such training. Cognitive behavior therapy can be used alone or in combination 
      with antidepressants to treat patients with panic disorder. Benzodiazepines are 
      effective in treating panic disorder symptoms, but they are less effective than 
      antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy.

TI  - Locus of control orientation in panic disorder and the differential effects of 
      treatment.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study the effects of treatment with cognitive therapy, 
      antidepressants or pill-placebo on the locus of control orientation in panic 
      disorder patients were analysed, as well as the relation of this panic locus of 
      control with panic frequency and cognitive measures of panic. METHODS: A 
      Multidimensional Anxiety Locus of Control scale (MALC) was developed and completed 
      with other measures (ACQ and BSQ) before and after treatment. Patients also kept a 
      panic diary. RESULTS: Four subscales were derived from the MALC: one Internal, and 
      three external (a Chance, a Medication, and a Therapist) locus of anxiety control 
      orientation scales. Cognitive therapy was superior over pill-placebo on most outcome 
      measures whereas antidepressants were only superior in reducing the number of panic 
      attacks. Treatment with cognitive therapy resulted in an increase of 'internal' 
      anxiety control orientation and a decrease of 'chance' and 'medication' orientation, 
      in comparison with antidepressant therapy. The residualized gain scores on the MALC 
      subscales correlated with clinical improvement in subjects treated with cognitive 
      therapy only. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the locus of control orientation is 
      important in evaluating the differential effects of treatments in panic disorder. A 
      differential effect on panic locus of control in favor of cognitive therapy in 
      comparison to medication was found.

TI  - Special feature: personality disorders: models for treatment and strategies for 
      treatment development.
PG  - 307-24
AB  - A critical review of the literature suggests that the only approaches specific to 
      the treatment of personality disorder that have been proven to be effective are 
      behavioral, cognitive behavioral, or psychopharmacological. Those investigations 
      have used a conventional protocol for clinical outcome studies commonly used in 
      medical science. This protocol is described in a listing of Empirically Validated 
      Therapies (EVT). The design calls for relatively brief treatments that are clearly 
      operationalized, and studied in terms of symptom change in a treatment group 
      relative to an appropriate clinical contrast group. It is argued here that such 
      relatively brief studies of symptom or specific behavioral change do not address 
      what is meant by personality disorder. The prevailing EVT model is challenged in two 
      ways: (1) Efficacy of the approaches that have followed this model, namely the 
      behavioral and psychopharmacological treatments, may have been overstated. (2) 
      Because they are so brief, and because they assess symptoms, rather than relevant 
      dynamic concepts like unconscious wishes and fears that organize personality, these 
      protocols seem inappropriate to the study of effective treatment of personality 
      disorder per se. Models that would be appropriate to treatment of personality 
      disorder require testable causal theory rationally linked to treatment 
      interventions, therapy process, and outcome measures. Some relevant modifications to 
      research protocol for psychopharmacological, as well as psychosocial treatments, are 
      suggested. A therapy approach that could meet these standards for testable causal 
      theory is sketched.

PG  - 30-2
AB  - Psychotherapy, both alone and in combination with pharmacotherapy, is one of the 
      most prevalent treatments for depression and anxiety. Research data are sparse, but 
      there is ample evidence that several psychotherapies are effective for acute 
      affective and panic disorders. The best data are for interpersonal and 
      cognitive-behavioral therapies, with only early reports on the more common 
      psychodynamic psychotherapies. There has been less study of more chronic disorders, 
      but once again the suggestion is that appropriate psychotherapy is effective. 
      Treatment should be active and focused on the patient's symptoms and current 
      problems, not on character pathology or developmental psychodynamics.

TI  - [Clinical study of severe anorexia nervosa: the role of intravenous 
      hyperalimentation therapy].
PG  - 198-214
AB  - In order to understand the psychopathology of severe anorexia nervosa (AN), and 
      determine appropriate therapeutic approaches, a clinical study was conducted on 13 
      patients with severe AN who were hospitalized and were treated with intravenous 
      hyperalimentation (IVH). The patients were divided into three types based on their 
      clinical symptoms and initiating factors: Type I (Restricting Type; "Non-dieters"), 
      Type II (Restricting Type: "Dieters"). Type III (Binge-eating/Purging Type). The 
      clinical features of each type were evaluated. Based on this evaluation, the basic 
      approach and the role of IVH in the treatment of each type are described as follows. 
      Type I: The patients experience loss of appetite and subsequently, suffer 
      involuntary weight loss as a result of psychological or physical stresses at school 
      and/or home. Since the patients do not intentionally restrict food intake, they 
      cannot explain the loss of appetite. The age at onset of this type is the youngest 
      among the three groups. The patients are introverted, passive and not good at 
      expressing their emotions. Therefore, it is often difficult to deepen the emotional 
      commitment further. It is possible to understand the pathology of Type I through the 
      psychosomatic model. IVH therapy promotes benign regression for Type I patients, so 
      that the mother-child relationship may be restored. As the therapeutic progress, the 
      mother child relationship occasionally become ambivalent. In such a case, it is 
      important for the treatment team to support independent activities of the patients. 
      Type II: The patients lose weight by intentionally restricting necessary food intake 
      for reasons such as beauty or sports. Any experience of failure in studies or sports 
      or trouble in complex personal relations can trigger the onset of AN. Weight loss is 
      looked as a great achievement, whereas weight gain is recognized as a serious 
      failure of self-control. Since type II patients understand the necessity of 
      receiving treatment, it is possible to establish a trusting relationship during 
      therapy. Their prognosis is generally good. The psychotherapeutic approach for Type 
      II patients is most effective in the context of a weight gain program utilizing 
      behavior therapy. It is important for the therapist to integrate psychological 
      approach with physiological approach using IVH, and to modify cognitive distortion 
      and body image disturbance. Type III: The patients have regularly engaged in binge 
      eating or purging (or both) in the progress of AN. But as they intensely fear 
      becoming fat, they refuse to maintain a minimally normal body weight. Therefore, 
      they exhibit recurrently inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent 
      weight gain. In the therapeutic sessions, they often become ambivalent and unstable, 
      showing dissatisfaction and reacting strongly against their therapists. The age at 
      onset is the oldest of the three types. The prognosis is not good in many cases. IVH 
      therapy may be required only in life-threatening situation for Type III patients. 
      And severe bulimic patients may require sufficient drug treatment. The patients 
      should be trained for interpersonal relationships at the day care unit or the 
      occupational therapy unit. And they should be encouraged to adapt to real life.

TI  - Self-inflicted eye injuries: case presentations and a literature review.
PG  - 470-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors' aim was to determine demographic and clinical correlates of 
      self-inflicted eye injury. METHODS: The authors reviewed 41 cases of patients with 
      self-inflicted eye injuries identified through MEDLARS searches of medical 
      literature for the period from 1980 to 1993 and four cases from the first author's 
      clinical practice. RESULTS: Most patients with self-inflicted eye injuries were 
      male, about 31 years old, and had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, drug or alcohol 
      abuse, depressive disorders, or other psychosis. Some patients experienced cognitive 
      distortions, often involving religious and sexual ideation, and intense fear around 
      the time they injured themselves. Thirty-three percent of the patients with 
      self-inflicted eye injuries also showed other types of self-injurious behavior. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Enucleation of the eye may serve as a defense against witnessing or 
      experiencing a forbidden act. Psychodynamic theories addressing self-mutilation do 
      not explain self-induced eye injury particularly well but may assist the therapist 
      in understanding motivation and in restructuring patients' behavior. Management of 
      these patients requires multidisciplinary, multimodal efforts involving medical 
      specialists, patients, family members, and staff.

TI  - Group psychotherapy of dysfunctional fear of progression in patients with chronic 
      arthritis or cancer.
PG  - 31-8
LID - 10.1159/000254903 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effectiveness of brief psychotherapeutic 
      group interventions in reducing dysfunctional fear of disease progression (FoP). The 
      interventions comprised either cognitive-behavioral group therapy or 
      supportive-experiential group therapy. We tested whether these generic interventions 
      would prove effective in different illness types. METHODS: Chronic arthritis in- 
      patients (n = 174) and cancer in-patients (n = 174), respectively, were randomized 
      to receive one of the two interventions. The patients provided data before 
      intervention, at discharge, and at 3 and 12 months of follow-up. FoP was the primary 
      outcome, secondary outcomes were anxiety, depression and quality of life. A 
      treatment-as-usual control group provided data on the primary outcome. RESULTS: 
      Patients with chronic arthritis indicated higher levels of FoP than cancer patients. 
      The results revealed that, compared with no specialized intervention, both group 
      therapies were effective in reducing dysfunctional FoP, but only among cancer 
      patients. The effect sizes were 0.54 (cognitive-behavioral therapy) and 0.50 
      (supportive experiential therapy). The interventions were not differently effective 
      in reducing the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunctional FoP can be 
      effectively targeted with brief group interventions. Psychotherapeutic interventions 
      for reducing FoP should focus on specific illness characteristics.

TI  - The evaluation of metacognitive beliefs and emotion recognition in panic disorder 
      and generalized anxiety disorder: effects on symptoms and comparison with healthy 
      control.
PG  - 293-301
LID - 10.1080/08039488.2019.1623317 [doi]
AB  - Background: The impairments in metacognitive functions and emotion recognition are 
      considered as liable factors in anxiety disorders. Aims: The better understanding of 
      these cognitive abilities might lead to develop more accurate treatment methods for 
      patients who suffer from anxiety. Methods: Forty-four patients with panic disorder 
      (PD), 37 individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and 44 healthy control 
      (HC) were participated in our study. Metacognition questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), 
      Reading The Mind From The Eyes Test and symptom severity tests were administered. 
      Results: Statistical analyses estimated the dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs and 
      disrupted emotion recognition in patients relative to HC. The 'need to control 
      thoughts' aspect of metacognitive beliefs was accounted for symptom severity in GAD. 
      Improper metacognitive beliefs were significantly predicted the PD and GAD. In 
      addition, impoverished emotion recognition predicted the GAD. Conclusions: Our study 
      revealed the role of inconvenient metacognitive beliefs and distorted emotion 
      recognition in PD and GAD. These findings might facilitate the treatment management 
      in cognitive therapies of anxiety disorders via pointing out more reasonable targets 
      across improper cognitive fields.

LID - 10.1016/j.yebeh.2019.106842 [doi]
AB  - Dravet syndrome is an intractable pediatric epilepsy associated with SCN1A 
      mutations. In addition to having a large seizure burden and a reduced lifespan, 
      patients with Dravet syndrome also exhibit delays in reaching normal developmental 
      milestones in attentional, emotional, and cognitive function. These developmental 
      delays manifest in autistic-like social withdrawal and compulsive behavior. 
      Additionally, cognitive impairments including deficits in sensorimotor processing 
      and memory function are present. Several mouse models utilizing heterozygous 
      deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a(+/-) mice) have been generated that recapitulate many 
      aspects of Dravet syndrome. Studies in these mouse models of Dravet syndrome have 
      characterized behavioral phenotypes in adult mice. In the present study, we 
      characterized the behavioral phenotype of Scn1a(+/-) mice generated by targeted 
      deletion of Scn1a exon 1 (Scn1a(tm1Kea)) during adolescence. Identifying behavioral 
      deficits in adolescent mice would more closely model the early onset of attentional, 
      emotional, and cognitive delays observed in patients with Dravet syndrome. The 
      behaviors of adolescent Scn1a(+/-) and wildtype (WT) mice were compared across 
      several behavioral domains. We assessed motor function (open-field test), 
      sociability and social recognition memory (three-chambered social preference and 
      social interaction tests), memory function (novel object recognition, Barnes maze, 
      fear conditioning paradigm), anxiety-related behavior (elevated plus maze and 
      open-field thigmotaxis), startle reflex and sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition 
      of startle (PPI) tests), and repetitive compulsive behavior (marble burying test). 
      Adolescent Scn1a(+/-) mice exhibited normal locomotor activity, marble burying 
      behavior, sociability, and sensorimotor gating. However, adolescent Scn1a(+/-) mice 
      displayed increased anxiety-related thigmotactic behavior, atypical fear expression, 
      blunted acoustic startle responses, and impaired social recognition and spatial 
      memory. Our results show that Scn1a(+/-) mice display various behavioral impairments 
      during adolescence, which provides a foundation for testing early intervention 
      therapies targeting developmental delays modeled in Dravet syndrome mice.

TI  - Making Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy scalable for cancer survivors: 
      a randomized non-inferiority trial of self-guided and technician-guided therapy.
PG  - 211-225
LID - 10.1007/s11764-019-00810-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness and acceptability of two low-intensity methods 
      of offering a transdiagnostic Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) 
      intervention for treating symptoms of anxiety and depression among cancer survivors. 
      METHODS: Cancer survivors with symptoms of anxiety or depression (n = 86) were 
      randomly assigned to receive a transdiagnostic ICBT programme (Wellbeing After 
      Cancer) that was either guided by a technician (n = 42) or self-guided (n = 44). 
      Measures of anxiety, depression, fear of cancer recurrence, and quality of life were 
      completed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 4 weeks following treatment 
      completion. RESULTS: Large within-group effect sizes were observed on measures of 
      depression, anxiety, and mental health-related quality of life (d range, 0.98-1.86) 
      at post-treatment. Medium effects were found for reductions in fear of cancer 
      recurrence (d range, 0.65-0.78). Non-inferiority was established for the primary 
      outcome measures of anxiety and depression. All participants reported high 
      satisfaction ratings of the programme; however, technician-guided participants were 
      slightly more satisfied with their level of support (d = 0.57, p = .014). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The Wellbeing After Cancer Course was associated with improved levels 
      of anxiety, depression, fear of cancer recurrence, and quality of life, regardless 
      of how ICBT was offered. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: ICBT is emerging as an 
      accessible and effective treatment for depression, anxiety, and fear of cancer 
      recurrence in cancer survivors. The success of non-therapist-guided options 
      increases the potential scalability of ICBT, which is particularly valuable for 
      cancer survivors from rural areas who have less access to mental health services.

TI  - Development and usability evaluation of an online self-management intervention for 
      fear of cancer recurrence (iConquerFear).
PG  - 98-106
LID - 10.1002/pon.5218 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate the usability of iConquerFear, an online 
      self-management adaptation of an efficacious face-to-face therapist-delivered 
      treatment for fear of cancer recurrence (FCR). METHODS: iConquerFear development was 
      theory based and person based. Development was guided by Ritterband et al's 
      behaviour change model for internet interventions. iConquerFear end users (cancer 
      survivors) provided iterative feedback in accordance with Yardley et al's 
      person-based approach to maximise engagement and usability. Online focus groups and 
      cognitive interviews were conducted to evaluate the usability of iConquerFear. 
      Discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed. RESULTS: 
      Five online FCR modules were developed. Twenty-three cancer survivors (47% of those 
      eligible) participated; 11/23 (58%) were breast cancer survivors, and average age 
      was 53 years (SD = 10.8). Thematic saturation was reached after six focus groups (n 
      = 16) and seven individual think-aloud interviews. Thematic analysis produced five 
      overarching themes: easy navigation essential; satisfaction and engagement with 
      content; flexible access is key; normalising and empowering; and a useful first 
      step. CONCLUSIONS: Online self-management interventions like iConquerFear have the 
      potential to address the unmet supportive care needs reported by burgeoning numbers 
      of cancer survivors. However, that potential may not be realised unless 
      interventions are rigorously developed and user tested, as benefits are constrained 
      by limited engagement. Themes from the usability testing of iConquerFear highlight 
      the importance of developing flexible, tailored, interactive, and contextual online 
      self-management interventions for people with cancer.

AB  - Vascular dementia is a serious problem as it creates significant disability and 
      dependency in the affected person. Lives of these patients can be improved through 
      the advent of novel drug targets which can be targeted by pharmacological therapies. 
      However, finding a precise and druggable target for vascular dementia is 
      experimentally impossible and challenging task owing to a complex and mostly unknown 
      interplay between the cognitive abilities of the brain with a diversity of vascular 
      diseases. To address this issue, we have systematically analyzed the literature 
      reports by using well-known methods and approaches of bioinformatics (viz. network 
      pharmacology, reverse pharmacology, enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways, biological 
      processes of Gene Ontology and DIAMOnD algorithm). Because glycogen synthase 
      kinase-3 (GSK-3) seems to be one of the most promising targets, therefore, we have 
      tested the capacity of lithium carbonate, a classical inhibitor of GSK-3, for 
      treatment of dementia resulting from mild chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in mice. To 
      this end, our study shows in-vivo validation of predicted target, i.e., 
      pharmacological deactivation of GSK-3 enzyme and its impact on cognitive abilities 
      employing a behavioral test battery, i.e., object recognition task, step-through 
      passive avoidance task, elevated plus maze task and water maze task. In this 
      framework, we observed that lithium carbonate attenuates recognition, emotion, 
      spatial and fear-motivated learning and memory impairments along with attenuation of 
      oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in 
      cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In conclusion, we propose GSK-3 as a promising drug 
      target for vascular dementia in light of experimental results and in-silico 
      predictions.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by 
      drastic alterations in mood, emotions, social abilities and cognition. Notably, one 
      aspect of PTSD, particularly in veterans, is its comorbidity with suicide. Elevated 
      aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in 
      reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a 
      well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a 
      peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory and impaired fear extinction 
      associated with neurochemical dysregulations in the brain circuitry regulating 
      emotion. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and 
      stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and 
      critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the 
      neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide 
      and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the 
      endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal 
      individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved 
      treatments for PTSD, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This 
      highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One 
      promising alternative to SSRIs points to stimulation of allopregnanolone 
      biosynthesis as a treatment and a valid end-point to predict treatment response in 
      PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the 
      endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a 
      preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive 
      PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of 
      neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer a novel promising biomarker 
      axis to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterised by a failure to maintain a normal 
      body weight due to a paucity of nutrition, an intense fear of gaining weight or 
      behaviour that prevents the individual from gaining weight, or both. The long-term 
      prognosis is often poor, with severe developmental, medical and psychosocial 
      complications, high rates of relapse and mortality. 'Family therapy approaches' 
      indicate a range of approaches, derived from different theories, that involve the 
      family in treatment. We have included therapies developed on the basis of dominant 
      family systems theories, approaches that are based on or broadly similar to the 
      family-based therapy derived from the Maudsley model, approaches that incorporate a 
      focus on cognitive restructuring, as well as approaches that involve the family 
      without articulation of a theoretical approach.This is an update of a Cochrane 
      Review first published in 2010. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of family 
      therapy approaches compared with standard treatment and other treatments for AN. 
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials 
      Register (CCMDCTR) and PsycINFO (OVID) (all years to April 2016). We ran additional 
      searches directly on Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
      MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 2008 and 2016 to 2018). We searched the World 
      Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov, together 
      with four theses databases (all years to 2018). We checked the reference lists of 
      all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have included in the 
      analyses only studies from searches conducted to April 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of family therapy approaches compared to any 
      other intervention or other types of family therapy approaches were eligible for 
      inclusion. We included participants of any age or gender with a primary clinical 
      diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors 
      selected the studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We used a random-effects 
      meta-analysis. We used the risk ratio (with a 95% confidence interval) to summarise 
      dichotomous outcomes and both the standardised mean difference and the mean 
      difference to summarise continuous measures. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 trials in 
      this version of the review (13 from the original 2010 review and 12 newly-included 
      studies). Sixteen trials were of adolescents, eight trials of adults (seven of these 
      in young adults aged up to 26 years) and one trial included three age groups: one 
      adolescent, one young adult and one adult. Most investigated family-based therapy or 
      variants. Reporting of trial conduct was generally inadequate, so that in a large 
      number of studies we rated the risk of bias as unclear for many of the domains. 
      Selective reporting bias was particularly problematic, with 68% of studies rated at 
      high risk of bias in this area, followed by incomplete outcome data, with 44% of 
      studies rated at high risk of bias in this area. For the main outcome measure of 
      remission there was some low-quality evidence (from only two studies, 81 
      participants) suggesting that family therapy approaches might offer some advantage 
      over treatment as usual on rates of remission, post intervention (risk ratio (RR) 
      3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 8.23; I(2) = 0%). However, at follow-up, 
      low-quality evidence from only one study suggested this effect was not maintained. 
      There was very low-quality evidence from only one trial, which means it is difficult 
      to determine whether family therapy approaches offer any advantage over educational 
      interventions for remission (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.53 to 153.79; 1 study, N = 30). 
      Similarly, there was very low-quality evidence from only five trials for remission 
      post-intervention, again meaning that it is difficult to determine whether there is 
      any advantage of family therapy approaches over psychological interventions (RR 
      1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; participants = 252; studies = 5; I(2) = 37%) and at 
      long-term follow-up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.28; participants = 200; studies = 4 
      with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I(2) = 
      0%). There was no indication that the age group had any impact on the overall 
      treatment effect; however, it should be noted that there were very few trials 
      undertaken in adults, with the age range of adult studies included in this analysis 
      from 20 to 27. There was some evidence of a small effect favouring family based 
      therapy compared with other psychological interventions in terms of weight gain 
      post-intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.63; 
      participants = 210; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons 
      for different age groups; I(2) = 11%) . Overall, there was insufficient evidence to 
      determine whether there were any differences between groups across all comparisons 
      for most of the secondary outcomes (weight, eating disorder psychopathology, 
      dropouts, relapse, or family functioning measures), either at post-intervention or 
      at follow-up. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a limited amount of low-quality 
      evidence to suggest that family therapy approaches may be effective compared to 
      treatment as usual in the short term. This finding is based on two trials that 
      included only a small number of participants, and both had issues about potential 
      bias. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is an advantage of 
      family therapy approaches in people of any age compared to educational interventions 
      (one study, very low quality) or psychological therapies (five studies, very low 
      quality). Most studies contributing to this finding were undertaken in adolescents 
      and youth. There are clear potential impacts on how family therapy approaches might 
      be delivered to different age groups and further work is required to understand what 
      the resulting effects on treatment efficacy might be. There is insufficient evidence 
      to determine whether one type of family therapy approach is more effective than 
      another. The field would benefit from further large, well-conducted trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure-based therapies are used to treat a variety of trauma- and 
      anxiety-related disorders by generating successful extinction following cue exposure 
      during treatment. The development of adjuvant strategies that accelerate extinction 
      learning, improve tolerability, and increase efficiency of treatment could increase 
      the efficacy of exposure-based therapies. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with 
      exposure can enhance fear extinction, in rat models of psychiatric disorders, and 
      chronic administration of VNS reduces anxiety in rats and humans. OBJECTIVE: We 
      tested whether VNS, like other cognitive enhancers, could produce generalization of 
      extinction for stimuli that are not presented during the extinction sessions, but 
      are associated with the fear event. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats underwent 
      auditory fear conditioning with two easily discriminable auditory stimuli. Following 
      fear conditioning, extinction training consisted of exposure to only one of the 
      conditioned sounds. Half of the rats received VNS and half received sham stimulation 
      during with sound presentations. VNS effects on anxiety were examined in a separate 
      study where VNS was administered prior to testing on the elevated plus maze. 
      RESULTS: Sham stimulated rats given 20 presentations of a conditioned stimulus (CS) 
      during the extinction session showed performance that was matched to VNS-treated 
      rats given only 4 presentations of the CS. Despite comparable levels of freezing to 
      the presented CS, only the VNS-treated rats showed a significant decrease in 
      freezing to the CS that was not presented. VNS-induced generalization of extinction 
      was observed only when the two sounds were paired with footshock within the same 
      fear conditioning session; VNS did not promote generalization of extinction when the 
      two sounds were conditioned on different days or in different contexts. On the 
      anxiety test, VNS administration significantly increased time spent in the open arms 
      of the elevated plus maze. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that VNS can 
      promote generalization of extinction to other stimuli associated with a specific 
      fear experience. Furthermore, non-contingent VNS appears to reduce anxiety. The 
      ability to generalize extinction and reduce anxiety makes VNS a potential candidate 
      for use as an adjunctive strategy to improve the efficacy and tolerability of 
      exposure-based therapies.

TI  - "Phobie à deux" and other reasons why clinicians do not apply exposure with response 
      prevention in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 162-176
LID - 10.1080/16506073.2018.1494750 [doi]
AB  - Meta-analyses suggest that exposure with response prevention (ERP) is the most 
      efficacious treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and treatment 
      guidelines for the disorder accordingly recommend ERP. Despite this, many 
      therapists, including those with a cognitive-behavioral therapeutic background, do 
      not perform ERP in patients with OCD. The present study aimed to elucidate the 
      reasons why. German therapists (N = 216) completed an anonymous online survey, the 
      newly developed Reasons for Not Performing Exposure in OCD Scale (REPEX), that 
      inquired whether, to what extent, and how they perform ERP in the treatment of OCD. 
      We also asked their reasons for not applying ERP in the past. Most therapists 
      considered ERP an efficient treatment for OCD. Marked differences emerged between 
      physicians and psychologists, however. The former used exposure less often and for a 
      shorter period, preferred in sensu to in vivo exposure, and conducted exposure less 
      often in the personal environment of the patient than did psychologists. Both groups 
      were familiar with clinical guidelines to a similar extent. A factor analysis of the 
      REPEX scale revealed five factors. Patient lack of motivation, preference for 
      exposure to be self-help as well as alleged organizational difficulties were 
      endorsed most often. The latter was correlated with the age of the therapist and was 
      far more often affirmed by physicians. Fear of side effects was named by a subgroup 
      of clinicians; in the context of patient ambivalence, this may foster "phobie à 
      deux". Unlike prior research, lack of expertise was rarely identified as a reason 
      not to use ERP. Recommendations for improving adherence to guidelines are discussed.

AB  - Most cancer survivors adjust well to life after cancer but some experience 
      persisting negative mood, such as cancer-related fears, posttraumatic stress, 
      anxiety, or depression. Mood fluctuations may not reach criteria for a clinical 
      diagnosis but subclinical symptoms can interfere with quality of life. Women, 
      adolescents, and young adults are particularly at risk for mood disturbances. 
      Behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacologic 
      treatments, can effectively treat these distressing emotions. Much of the research 
      on managing emotional needs after cancer has been completed with breast cancer 
      survivors and more work is needed with diverse groups of survivors.

TI  - Clinical Hypnosis, an Effective Mind-Body Modality for Adolescents with Behavioral 
      and Physical Complaints.
LID - 10.3390/children4040019 [doi]
LID - 19
AB  - Mind-body medicine is a system of health practices that includes 
      meditation/relaxation training, guided imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback, yoga, 
      art/music therapy, prayer, t'ai chi, and psychological therapies such as cognitive 
      behavioral therapy. Clinical hypnosis is an important mind-body tool that serves as 
      an adjunct to conventional medical care for the adolescent patient. Clinical 
      hypnosis specifically uses self-directed therapeutic suggestions to cultivate the 
      imagination and facilitate the mind-body connection, leading to positive emotional 
      and physical well-being. There are many similarities between clinical hypnosis and 
      other mind-body/self-regulatory modalities such as visual imagery, mindfulness 
      meditation, yoga, and biofeedback that incorporate experiential learning and 
      mechanisms for change. They may be viewed as subtypes of the hypnotic experience and 
      share the common experience of trance as the entrée into self-empowered change in 
      physiologic and psychological states. Clinical hypnosis can be used by health care 
      providers to teach adolescents coping skills to deal with a wide variety of 
      conditions such as chronic headaches, recurrent abdominal pain, anxiety, depression, 
      grief and bereavement, phobias, anger, family stressors, sleep disorders, or 
      enuresis. Clinical vignettes are given to help illustrate the effectiveness of 
      hypnosis in adolescents.

TI  - The core symptoms of bulimia nervosa, anxiety, and depression: A network analysis.
PG  - 340-354
LID - 10.1037/abn0000254 [doi]
AB  - Bulimia nervosa (BN) is characterized by symptoms of binge eating and compensatory 
      behavior, and overevaluation of weight and shape, which often co-occur with symptoms 
      of anxiety and depression. However, there is little research identifying which 
      specific BN symptoms maintain BN psychopathology and how they are associated with 
      symptoms of depression and anxiety. Network analyses represent an emerging method in 
      psychopathology research to examine how symptoms interact and may become 
      self-reinforcing. In the current study of adults with a Diagnostic and Statistical 
      Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of BN (N = 196), we 
      used network analysis to identify the central symptoms of BN, as well as symptoms 
      that may bridge the association between BN symptoms and anxiety and depression 
      symptoms. Results showed that fear of weight gain was central to BN psychopathology, 
      whereas binge eating, purging, and restriction were less central in the symptom 
      network. Symptoms related to sensitivity to physical sensations (e.g., changes in 
      appetite, feeling dizzy, and wobbly) were identified as bridge symptoms between BN, 
      and anxiety and depressive symptoms. We discuss our findings with respect to 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment approaches for BN. These findings suggest that 
      treatments for BN should focus on fear of weight gain, perhaps through exposure 
      therapies. Further, interventions focusing on exposure to physical sensations may 
      also address BN psychopathology, as well as co-occurring anxiety and depressive 
      symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Creating state of the art, next-generation Virtual Reality exposure therapies for 
      anxiety disorders using consumer hardware platforms: design considerations and 
      future directions.
PG  - 404-420
LID - 10.1080/16506073.2017.1280843 [doi]
AB  - Decades of research and more than 20 randomized controlled trials show that Virtual 
      Reality exposure therapy (VRET) is effective in reducing fear and anxiety. 
      Unfortunately, few providers or patients have had access to the costly and technical 
      equipment previously required. Recent technological advances in the form of consumer 
      Virtual Reality (VR) systems (e.g. Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear), however, now make 
      widespread use of VRET in clinical settings and as self-help applications possible. 
      In this literature review, we detail the current state of VR technology and discuss 
      important therapeutic considerations in designing self-help and clinician-led VRETs, 
      such as platform choice, exposure progression design, inhibitory learning 
      strategies, stimuli tailoring, gamification, virtual social learning and more. We 
      illustrate how these therapeutic components can be incorporated and utilized in VRET 
      applications, taking full advantage of the unique capabilities of virtual 
      environments, and showcase some of these features by describing the development of a 
      consumer-ready, gamified self-help VRET application for low-cost commercially 
      available VR hardware. We also raise and discuss challenges in the planning, 
      development, evaluation, and dissemination of VRET applications, including the need 
      for more high-quality research. We conclude by discussing how new technology (e.g. 
      eye-tracking) can be incorporated into future VRETs and how widespread use of VRET 
      self-help applications will enable collection of naturalistic "Big Data" that 
      promises to inform learning theory and behavioral therapy in general.

TI  - Using Religious Songs as an Integrative and Complementary Therapy for the Management 
      of Psychological Symptoms Among African American Cancer Survivors.
PG  - 488-494
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acupuncture, acupressure, yoga, meditation, cognitive-behavioral 
      techniques, and, to a lesser extent, music are among those integrative and 
      complementary therapies with known beneficial effects on psychological symptoms. 
      However, noticeably absent from this research is the use of religious song as a type 
      of integrative and complementary therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      explore how religious songs were used to alleviate psychological symptoms associated 
      with a cancer diagnosis among a sample of older African American cancer survivors. 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-one older African American cancer survivors residing in 
      the Southeastern US participated in a qualitative descriptive study involving 
      criterion sampling, open-ended semistructured interviews, and qualitative content 
      analysis. RESULTS: Participants used religious songs in response to feeling 
      depressed, low, or sad; feeling weak and seeking strength to endure treatment; and 
      feeling worried, anxious, or fearful. Religious songs were also a source of support 
      and hope. Types of religious songs included instructive, thanksgiving and praise, 
      memory of forefathers, communication with God, and life after death. CONCLUSION: 
      Religious songs appear to be an important form of religious expression in this 
      population and used to manage psychological symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 
      Integrative and complementary oncology therapy has generally focused on yoga, 
      meditation, acupuncture, and cognitive-behavioral techniques. However, religious 
      songs are an important strategy used among older African American cancer patients. 
      Religious songs can be readily integrated into cancer care. The incorporation of 
      religious songs into spiritually based support groups and other integrative and 
      complementary therapies might enhance health outcomes among this medically 
      underserved cancer population.

AB  - Functional and psychiatric disorders that cause vestibular symptoms (i.e., vertigo, 
      unsteadiness, and dizziness) are common. In fact, they are more common than many 
      well-known structural vestibular disorders. Neurologists and otologists are more 
      likely to encounter patients with vestibular symptoms due to persistent 
      postural-perceptual dizziness or panic disorder than Ménière's disease or bilateral 
      vestibular loss. Successful approaches to identifying functional and psychiatric 
      causes of vestibular symptoms can be incorporated into existing practices without 
      much difficulty. The greatest challenge is to set aside dichotomous thinking that 
      strongly emphasizes investigations of structural diseases in favor of a 
      three-pronged approach that assesses structural, functional, and psychiatric 
      disorders simultaneously. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying functional and 
      psychiatric causes of vestibular symptoms are better understood than many clinicians 
      realize. Research methods such as advanced posturographic analysis and functional 
      brain imaging will push this knowledge further in the next few years. Treatment 
      plans that include patient education, vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive and 
      behavioral therapies, and medications substantially reduce morbidity and offer the 
      potential for sustained remission when applied systematically. Diagnostic and 
      therapeutic approaches are necessarily multidisciplinary in nature, but they are 
      well within the purview of collaborative care teams or networks of clinicians 
      coordinated with the neurologists and otologists whom patients consult first.

AB  - Chronic pain and mental health disorders are common in the general population, and 
      epidemiological studies suggest that a bidirectional relationship exists between 
      these 2 conditions. The observations from functional imaging studies suggest that 
      this bidirectional relationship is due in part to shared neural mechanisms. In 
      addition to depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders, individuals with 
      chronic pain are at risk of other mental health problems including suicide and 
      cigarette smoking and many have sustained sexual violence. Within the broader 
      biopsychosocial model of pain, the fear-avoidance model explains how behavioral 
      factors affect the temporal course of chronic pain and provides the framework for an 
      array of efficacious behavioral interventions including cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy, acceptance-based therapies, and multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation. 
      Concomitant pain and mental health disorders often complicate pharmacological 
      management, but several drug classes, including serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake 
      inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants, have efficacy for both 
      conditions and should be considered first-line treatment agents.

TI  - A Review of Esophageal Chest Pain.
PG  - 759-66
AB  - Noncardiac chest pain is a term that encompasses all causes of chest pain after a 
      cardiac source has been excluded. This article focuses on esophageal sources for 
      chest pain. Esophageal chest pain (ECP) is common, affects quality of life, and 
      carries a substantial health care burden. The lack of a systematic approach toward 
      the diagnosis and treatment of ECP has led to significant disability and increased 
      health care costs for this condition. Identifying the underlying cause(s) or 
      mechanism(s) for chest pain is key for its successful management. Common etiologies 
      include gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal hypersensitivity, dysmotility, 
      and psychological conditions, including panic disorder and anxiety. However, the 
      pathophysiology of this condition is not yet fully understood. Randomized controlled 
      trials have shown that proton pump inhibitor therapy (either omeprazole, 
      lansoprazole, or rabeprazole) can be effective. Evidence for the use of 
      antidepressants and the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline is fair. 
      Psychological treatments, notably cognitive behavioral therapy, may be useful in 
      select patients. Surgery is not recommended. There remains a large unmet need for 
      identifying the phenotype and prevalence of pathophysiologic mechanisms of ECP as 
      well as for well-designed multicenter clinical trials of current and novel 
      therapies.

TI  - Animal models for posttraumatic stress disorder: An overview of what is used in 
      research.
PG  - 387-96
LID - 10.5498/wjp.v5.i4.387 [doi]
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common anxiety disorder characterised by 
      its persistence of symptoms after a traumatic experience. Although some patients can 
      be cured, many do not benefit enough from the psychological therapies or medication 
      strategies used. Many researchers use animal models to learn more about the disorder 
      and several models are available. The most-used physical stressor models are 
      single-prolonged stress, restraint stress, foot shock, stress-enhanced fear 
      learning, and underwater trauma. Common social stressors are housing instability, 
      social instability, early-life stress, and social defeat. Psychological models are 
      not as diverse and rely on controlled exposure to the test animal's natural 
      predator. While validation of these models has been resolved with replicated 
      symptoms using analogous stressors, translating new findings to human patients 
      remains essential for their impact on the field. Choosing a model to experiment with 
      can be challenging; this overview of what is possible with individual models may aid 
      in making a decision.

TI  - Veterans' perspectives on initiating evidence-based psychotherapy for posttraumatic 
      stress disorder.
PG  - 539-46
LID - 10.1037/tra0000035 [doi]
AB  - Evidence-based psychotherapies (EBP) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are 
      effective at reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Despite their 
      effectiveness, few veterans receive EBP. To examine veterans' experiences initiating 
      EBP for PTSD, we conducted qualitative interviews with those who completed at least 
      8 sessions of prolonged exposure (PE) or cognitive processing therapy (CPT). 
      Veterans reported learning about EBP from therapists, psychiatrists, and other 
      veterans. Ambivalence and delaying EBP initiation were common. Barriers included 
      fears that EBP would increase symptoms, beliefs that avoidance was helpful, 
      disbelief of the therapy rationale, particularly for PE, and less commonly, lack of 
      knowledge about EBP. Facilitators included feeling a "need to talk about it," prior 
      treatment that increased confidence in the ability to handle EBP, prior knowledge of 
      the EBP therapist, provider behaviors that facilitated buy-in, encouragement from 
      other veterans, and desperation for symptom relief. There were few differences in 
      barriers and facilitators between PE and CPT, although veterans in PE were more 
      likely to express skepticism of the therapy rationale. These results highlight the 
      importance of "word of mouth" about EBP among the veteran community and identifying 
      provider behaviors that may promote EBP initiation.

TI  - Barriers to treatment for older adults seeking psychological therapy.
PG  - 1227-36
LID - 10.1017/S1041610215000241 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults with mental health disorders underutilize mental health 
      services more than other adults. While there are well known general barriers to help 
      seeking across the population, specific barriers for older adults include 
      difficulties with transportation, beliefs that it is normal to be anxious and 
      depressed in old age, and beliefs by referrers that psychological therapy is less 
      likely to be effective. This study examined barriers related to identifying the need 
      for help, seeking help and participating in therapy in a clinical population of 
      older adults. METHOD: Sixty older adults (aged 60-79 years) with comorbid anxiety 
      and unipolar mood disorders completed barriers to treatment questionnaires before 
      and after psychological group treatment, as well as measures of cognitive ability, 
      anxiety, depression, and quality of life at baseline. RESULTS: The greatest barriers 
      to help seeking related to difficulties identifying the need for help, with 50% of 
      the sample reporting their belief that their symptoms were normal as a major 
      barrier. Other major barriers identified were related to: self-reliance, cost of 
      treatment, and fear of medication replicating previous findings. The main barriers 
      reported for difficulties in continuing therapy included not finding therapy 
      helpful, cost of treatment, and thinking that the therapist did not understand their 
      issues. CONCLUSIONS: The main barriers identified related to issues with identifying 
      the need to seek help. More attention is needed to educate older adults and 
      professionals about the need for, and effectiveness of, psychological therapies for 
      older adults with anxiety and depression to reduce this barrier to help seeking.

TI  - A prospective 2-year examination of cognitive and behavioral correlates of provoked 
      vestibulodynia outcomes.
PG  - 333-41
LID - 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is a common genital pain disorder in women 
      that is associated with sexual dysfunction and lowered sexual satisfaction. A 
      potentially applicable cognitive-behavioral model of chronic pain and disability is 
      the fear-avoidance model (FAM) of pain. The FAM posits that cognitive variables, 
      such as pain catastrophizing, fear, and anxiety lead to avoidance of pain-provoking 
      behaviors (eg, intercourse), resulting in continued pain and disability. Although 
      some of the FAM variables have been shown to be associated with PVD pain and 
      sexuality outcomes, the model as a whole has never been tested in this population. 
      An additional protective factor, pain self-efficacy (SE), is also associated with 
      PVD, but has not been tested within the FAM model. AIMS: Using a 2-year longitudinal 
      design, we examine (1) whether initial levels (T1) of the independent FAM variables 
      and pain SE were associated with changes in pain, sexual function, and sexual 
      satisfaction over the 2-year time period; (2) the prospective contribution of 
      changes in cognitive-affective (FAM) variables to changes in pain, and sexuality 
      outcomes; and (3) whether these were mediated by behavioral change (avoidance of 
      intercourse). METHODS: A sample of 222 women with PVD completed self-report measures 
      of FAM variables, SE, pain, sexual function, and sexual satisfaction at time 1 and 
      at a 2-year follow-up. Structural equation modeling with Latent Difference Scores 
      was used to examine changes and to examine mediation between variables. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES: Questionnaires included the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, McGill Pain 
      Questionnaire, Trait Anxiety Inventory, Pain Self-Efficacy Scale, and Global Measure 
      of Sexual Satisfaction, Female Sexual Function Index. RESULTS: Participants who 
      reported higher SE at T1 reported greater declines in pain, greater increases in 
      sexual satisfaction, and greater declines in sexual function over the 2 time points. 
      The overall change model did not support the FAM using negative cognitive-affective 
      variables. Only increases in pain SE were associated with reductions in pain 
      intensity. The relationship between changes in SE and changes in pain was partially 
      mediated through changes in avoidance (more intercourse attempts). The same pattern 
      of results was found for changes in sexual satisfaction as the outcome, and a 
      partial mediation effect was found. There were no significant predictors of changes 
      in sexual function other than T1 SE. DISCUSSION: Changes in both cognitive and 
      behavioral variables were significantly associated with improved pain and sexual 
      satisfaction outcomes. However, it was the positive changes in SE that better 
      predicted changes in avoidance behavior, pain, and sexual satisfaction. 
      Cognitive-behavior therapy is often focused on changing negative pain-related 
      cognitions to reduce avoidance and pain, but the present results demonstrate the 
      potential importance of bolstering positive self-beliefs as well. Indeed, before 
      engaging in exposure therapies, SE beliefs should be assessed and potentially 
      targeted to improve adherence to exposure strategies.

TI  - Treating generalized anxiety disorder using complementary and alternative medicine.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - CONTEXT: The high comorbidity rate of generalized anxiety disorders (GADs) with 
      other diagnoses-such as panic disorder, depression, alcohol abuse, posttraumatic 
      stress disorder, insomnia, and obsessive compulsive disorder- make it one of the 
      most common diagnoses found in primary care, with women predominantly affected. It 
      is estimated that 5.4%-7.6% of primary care visits are associated with GAD and in 
      addition to impairments in mental health there is additional impairment in pain, 
      function, and activities of daily life, accelerating the need to reconsider the 
      medical management of this disorder and move from the traditional medical model to a 
      more holistic approach, focusing on self-care. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to 
      investigate the effectiveness of a pilot program that used multiple complementary 
      and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies, focusing on self-care behaviors for 
      treatment of GAD. DESIGN: The study used a quasi-experimental, pretestposttest 
      design to evaluate the benefits of the multitherapy program for one group of 
      individuals with GAD. SETTING: The study occurred at a military treatment facility 
      in the Pacific Northwest. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were a convenience sample of 
      volunteers seeking treatment at the military treatment facility. The study enrolled 
      participants (N = 37) if they had a documented history of GAD or met screening 
      criteria for GAD using the GAD-7. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received acupuncture 
      treatments once/wk for 6 wks and engaged in yogic breathing exercises, self- and/or 
      partner-assisted massage therapy using scented oils, episodic journaling, nutrition 
      counseling, and exercise. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest was the 
      reduction in anxiety as measured by the anxiety subscale on the Depression Anxiety 
      Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), which assesses three negative affective states: (1) 
      depression (DASS-D), (2) anxiety (DASS-A), and (3) stress (DASS-S). The research 
      team also measured preand post-GAD-7 scores since it used them as a screening 
      criterion for enrollment. In addition, the team assessed participants' levels of 
      pain on a Likert scale. RESULTS: Of the originally enrolled participants, 68% 
      completed the program (n = 25). The study found significant reductions in anxiety 
      pre- and posttest using GAD-7 and identified overall and individual subscale 
      reductions on the DASS-21. While not specifically targeted for treatment, secondary 
      exploratory outcomes included reductions in use of anxiolytic medication and in the 
      pain scale. The study considered the burden of use of multiple therapies upon 
      participants; however, participation in the study's therapies was high. CONCLUSION: 
      The findings in this pilot study suggest multimodal interventions focusing on 
      self-care behaviors may be feasible for patients seeking therapies that are adjunct 
      or alternative to conventional treatments. The study also suggested that this type 
      of patient will participate in multitherapy options, and it offers support for 
      expanding the conceptualization of and treatment for GAD by integrating CAM into 
      existing cognitive-behavioral models.

AB  - This study investigates neuronal activation patterns during the psychotherapeutic 
      process, assuming that change dynamics undergo critical instabilities and 
      discontinuous transitions. An internet-based system was used to collect daily 
      self-assessments during inpatient therapies. A dynamic complexity measure was 
      applied to the resulting time series. Critical phases of the change process were 
      indicated by the maxima of the varying complexity. Repeated functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements were conducted over the course of the therapy. 
      The study was realized with 9 patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder 
      (subtype: washing/contamination fear) and 9 matched healthy controls. For 
      symptom-provocative stimulation individualized pictures from patients' personal 
      environments were used. The neuronal responses to these disease-specific pictures 
      were compared to the responses during standardized disgust-provoking and neutral 
      pictures. Considerably larger neuronal changes in therapy-relevant brain areas 
      (cingulate cortex/supplementary motor cortex, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex, bilateral insula, bilateral parietal cortex, cuneus) were observed during 
      critical phases (order transitions), as compared to non-critical phases, and also 
      compared to healthy controls. The data indicate that non-stationary changes play a 
      crucial role in the psychotherapeutic process supporting self-organization and 
      complexity models of therapeutic change.

AB  - Over 80% of people with social anxiety disorder (SAD) do not receive any type of 
      treatment, despite the existence of effective evidence-based treatments. Barriers to 
      treatment include lack of trained therapists (particularly in nonmetropolitan 
      areas), logistical difficulties (e.g., cost, time, transportation), concerns 
      regarding social stigma, and fear of negative evaluation from health care providers. 
      Interventions conducted through electronic communication media, such as the 
      Internet, have the potential to reach individuals who otherwise would not have 
      access to evidence-based treatments. Second Life is an online virtual world that 
      holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments. We 
      assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based 
      behavior therapy in Second Life to treat adults with generalized SAD. Participants 
      (n=14) received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pretreatment, 
      midtreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the 
      treatment program as acceptable and feasible, despite frequently encountered 
      technical difficulties. Analyses showed significant pretreatment to follow-up 
      improvements in social anxiety symptoms, depression, disability, and quality of 
      life, with effect sizes comparable to previously published results of studies 
      delivering in-person cognitive behavior therapy for SAD. Implications and future 
      directions are discussed.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) reduces 
      symptoms of intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but the mechanism of 
      action is unknown. OCD is characterized by avoidance behaviors that fail to 
      extinguish, and DBS could act, in part, by facilitating extinction of fear. We 
      investigated this possibility by using auditory fear conditioning in rats, for which 
      the circuits of fear extinction are well characterized. We found that DBS of the VS 
      (the VC/VS homolog in rats) during extinction training reduced fear expression and 
      strengthened extinction memory. Facilitation of extinction was observed for a 
      specific zone of dorsomedial VS, just above the anterior commissure; stimulation of 
      more ventrolateral sites in VS impaired extinction. DBS effects could not be 
      obtained with pharmacological inactivation of either dorsomedial VS or ventrolateral 
      VS, suggesting an extrastriatal mechanism. Accordingly, DBS of dorsomedial VS (but 
      not ventrolateral VS) increased expression of a plasticity marker in the prelimbic 
      and infralimbic prefrontal cortices, the orbitofrontal cortex, the amygdala central 
      nucleus (lateral division), and intercalated cells, areas known to learn and express 
      extinction. Facilitation of fear extinction suggests that, in accord with clinical 
      observations, DBS could augment the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapies 
      for OCD.

TI  - Treatment of depression in patients with epilepsy.
PG  - 371-9
LID - 10.1007/s11940-011-0127-8 [doi]
AB  - In this article, we review the current best evidence for the treatment of depression 
      in patients with epilepsy. Depression is a common epilepsy comorbidity, but it is 
      often unrecognized. The most important step in appropriately managing mood disorders 
      in this population is making the diagnosis. Clinical vigilance and routine use of a 
      validated screening tool can improve detection and quality of care. As is 
      increasingly the case for the general population, persons with epilepsy are often 
      interested in exploring alternative therapies for chronic conditions, including 
      depression. Unfortunately, the benefit of complementary and alternative therapies 
      for depression currently is largely unproven for persons with a seizure history, 
      although an early study of exercise for mild depression has shown some benefit. 
      Concerns about drug interactions, side effects, and expense may be barriers to the 
      prescription of antidepressant medications for people requiring chronic 
      antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. For this reason, use of an AED with 
      mood-stabilizing properties has appeal and may be appropriate for selected 
      individuals with mild depressive symptoms. Undue fear of lowering seizure threshold 
      should not preclude the prescription of an antidepressant medication, as the 
      perceived risks are often overestimated and rarely outweigh the risk of leaving 
      depression untreated. At present, the best evidence for efficacy and safety support 
      the use of citalopram, sertraline, or mirtazapine as initial pharmacotherapy, 
      whereas bupropion should be avoided. Start low, go slow, and use the lowest 
      effective dose. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a valuable adjunct to antidepressant 
      therapy in this population. For people with refractory partial epilepsy and 
      refractory depression, vagus nerve stimulation has some appeal, in that it may be 
      beneficial for both conditions, but the efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation in 
      improving mood in patients with epilepsy remains unclear.

TI  - Virtual reality treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder due to motor vehicle 
      accident.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex, multifaceted disorder 
      encompassing behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and physiological factors. Although 
      PTSD was only codified in 1980, there has been an increasing interest in this area 
      of research. Unfortunately, relatively little attention has been given to the 
      psychological treatment of motor vehicle accident survivors, which is remarkable 
      because vehicular collisions are deemed the number one cause of PTSD. As the 
      emotional consequences of vehicular collisions prevail, so does the need for more 
      effective treatments. Randomized controlled clinical trials have identified 
      exposure-based therapies as being the most efficacious for extinguishing fears. One 
      type of exposure-based treatment, called virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), 
      provides a safe, controlled, and effective therapeutic alternative that is not 
      dependent on real-life props, situations, or even a person's imagination 
      capabilities. This modality, while relatively new, has been implemented successfully 
      in the treatment of a variety of anxiety disorders and may offer a particularly 
      beneficial and intermediary step for the treatment of collision-related PTSD. In 
      particular, VRET combined with physiological monitoring and feedback provides a 
      unique opportunity for individuals to objectively recognize both anxiety and 
      relaxation; learn how to manage their anxiety during difficult, albeit simulated, 
      driving conditions; and then transfer these skills onto real-life roadways.

TI  - The influence of gonadal hormones on conditioned fear extinction in healthy humans.
PG  - 652-8
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.04.030 [doi]
AB  - Recent rodent studies suggest that gonadal hormones influence extinction of 
      conditioned fear. Here we investigated sex differences in, and the influence of 
      estradiol and progesterone on, fear extinction in healthy humans. Men and women 
      underwent a two-day paradigm in which fear conditioning and extinction learning took 
      place on day 1 and extinction recall was tested on day 2. Visual cues were used as 
      the conditioned stimuli and a mild electric shock was used as the unconditioned 
      stimulus. Skin conductance was recorded throughout the experiment and used to 
      measure conditioned responses (CRs). Blood samples were obtained from all women to 
      measure estradiol and progesterone levels. We found that higher estradiol during 
      extinction learning enhanced subsequent extinction recall but had no effects on fear 
      acquisition or extinction learning itself. Sex differences were only observed during 
      acquisition, with men exhibiting significantly higher CRs. After dividing women into 
      low- and high-estradiol groups, men showed comparable extinction recall to 
      high-estradiol women, and both of these groups showed higher extinction recall than 
      low-estradiol women. Therefore, sex differences in extinction memory emerged only 
      after taking into account women's estradiol levels. Lower estradiol may impair 
      extinction consolidation in women. These findings could have practical applications 
      in the treatment of anxiety disorders through cognitive and behavioral therapies.

TI  - Inhibitors of class 1 histone deacetylases reverse contextual memory deficits in a 
      mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 870-80
LID - 10.1038/npp.2009.197 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by 
      cognitive impairments that progress to dementia and death. The earliest symptoms of 
      AD present as a relatively pure deficit in memory retrieval. Therefore, drug 
      treatments that intervene in the early stages of AD by rescuing memory deficits 
      could be promising therapies to slow, or even reverse progression of the disease. In 
      this study, we tested the potential of systemic histone deacetylase inhibitor 
      (HDACi) treatment to rescue cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD. APPswe/PS1dE9 
      mice showed pronounced contextual memory impairments beginning at 6 months of age. 
      Chronic HDACi injections (2-3 weeks) did not alter contextual memory formation in 
      normal mice, but had profound effects in transgenic animals. Injections of sodium 
      valproate, sodium butyrate, or vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; Zolinza) 
      completely restored contextual memory in these mutant mice. Further behavioral 
      testing of the HDACi-treated transgenic mice showed that the newly consolidated 
      memories were stably maintained over a 2-week period. Measurement of the HDAC 
      isoform selectivity profile of sodium valproate, sodium butyrate, and vorinostat 
      revealed the common inhibition of class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3, 8) with little effect 
      on the class IIa HDAC family members (HDAC4, 5, 7, 9) and inhibition of HDAC6 only 
      by vorinostat. These preclinical results indicate that targeted inhibition of class 
      I HDAC isoforms is a promising avenue for treating the cognitive deficits associated 
      with early stage AD.

AB  - The care of patients who suffer from physical pain and a psychiatric illness is 
      typically challenging because of the complex interplay of affective, behavioral, 
      cognitive, and physical aspects of pain. Psychiatrists are often asked to evaluate 
      patients with pain because of a concern for comorbid depression and anxiety, and 
      fears of suicidality as a result of pain. This article reviews the pathophysiology 
      of comorbid pain, anxiety, and depression, along with the treatment modalities 
      (pharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, and "alternative") that may benefit all three 
      conditions.

      reduced by a single session of therapist instructions for self-exposure to fear 
      cues. Eight single-case experimental studies examined whether such instructions were 
      as effective when delivered through a self-help manual after an initial assessment. 
      After two baseline assessments conducted at the participants homes, the manual was 
      delivered to the participants, who were then assessed at week 10 (post-treatment) 
      and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month post-treatment. After minimal improvement during the 
      baseline, treatment achieved marked improvement in seven survivors, leading to 
      effect sizes comparable to those obtained by therapist-delivered treatment. 
      Self-help appears to be a promising approach in cost-effective survivor care.

TI  - [Process analysis of cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy for patients with 
      panic disorder].
PG  - 289-99
AB  - The study explores the verbal interaction relationship between therapists and 
      members, and the interaction model of this group. Six subjects were chosen by 
      convenience sampling from the psychiatric OPD of a medical center in the Taichung 
      area. Subjects with informed consent participated in a 12-week course of closed 
      group psychotherapy. All data was tape-recorded and the Hill Interaction Matrix 
      (HIM) scale was applied for simultaneous triangulation, in order to analyze the 
      group's dynamic development of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy for patients with 
      panic disorder. The results indicated that the interactive relationship between 
      therapists and members fluctuated during the group process. Development of the group 
      process can be subdivided into three stages: initial stage-adaptive and familiar, 
      middle stage-explorative, and terminal stage-productive. The amount of verbal 
      interaction was greatest in the third quadrant. In the group interaction model, the 
      therapist tended to explore the members' problems most. Providing support was the 
      second most frequent. Meanwhile, members also tended to discuss personal problems. 
      It was revealed that the verbal interaction of the therapists and members were the 
      same. The content style of this group session is member-centered, and work style is 
      pre-worked. The results showed that the group sessions did have great therapeutic 
      value for members.

TI  - Neurocognitive mechanisms of anxiety: an integrative account.
PG  - 307-16
AB  - Anxiety can be hugely disruptive to everyday life. Anxious individuals show 
      increased attentional capture by potential signs of danger, and interpret 
      expressions, comments and events in a negative manner. These cognitive biases have 
      been widely explored in human anxiety research. By contrast, animal models have 
      focused upon the mechanisms underlying acquisition and extinction of conditioned 
      fear, guiding exposure-based therapies for anxiety disorders. Recent neuroimaging 
      studies of conditioned fear, attention to threat and interpretation of emotionally 
      ambiguous stimuli indicate common amygdala-prefrontal circuitry underlying these 
      processes, and suggest that the balance of activity within this circuitry is altered 
      in anxiety, creating a bias towards threat-related responses. This provides a focus 
      for future translational research, and targeted pharmacological and cognitive 
      interventions.

TI  - Multiple channel exposure therapy: combining cognitive-behavioral therapies for the 
      treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder with panic attacks.
PG  - 70-94
AB  - A large proportion of patients who present for treatment of posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) experience comorbid panic attacks, yet it is unclear to what extent 
      currently available PTSD treatment programs address this problem. Here we describe a 
      newly developed treatment, multiple-channel exposure therapy (M-CET), for comorbid 
      PTSD and panic attacks. The treatment utilizes elements of cognitive processing 
      therapy treatment for PTSD and elements of panic control treatment to target 
      physiological, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. Preliminary results suggest that 
      M-CET may provide a promising treatment program for a subset of patients with PTSD 
      who experience panic attacks. In addition, guidelines for conducting M-CET with 
      clients who have been exposed to diverse traumatic events are provided.

TI  - Lowering fear-avoidance and enhancing function through exposure in vivo. A multiple 
      baseline study across six patients with back pain.
PG  - 8-16
AB  - This study investigated the effects of an exposure in vivo treatment for chronic 
      pain patients with high levels of fear and avoidance. The fear-avoidance model 
      offers an enticing explanation of why some back pain patients develop persistent 
      disability, stressing the role of catastrophic interpretations; largely fueled by 
      beliefs and expectations that activity will cause injury and will worsen the pain 
      problem. Recently, an exposure in vivo treatment was developed that aims to enhance 
      function by directly addressing these fears and expectations. The purpose of this 
      study was to describe the short-term, consequent effect of an exposure in vivo 
      treatment. The study employed a multiple baseline design with six patients who were 
      selected based on their high levels of fear and avoidance. The results demonstrated 
      clear decreases in rated fear and avoidance beliefs while function increased 
      substantially. These improvements were observed even though rated pain intensity 
      actually decreased somewhat. Thus, the results replicate and extend the findings of 
      previous studies to a new setting, with other therapists and a new research design. 
      These results, together with the initial studies, provide a basis for pursuing and 
      further developing the exposure technique and to test it in group designs with 
      larger samples.

TI  - [Effects and cost-effectiveness analysis of inpatient treatment for somatoform 
      disorders].
PG  - 136-46
AB  - Patients with somatoform disorders represent an expensive problem group of the 
      healthcare system characterized by inappropriately high medical costs. This paper 
      describes a controlled inpatient treatment study using a cognitive-behavioral 
      approach. The aim of this treatment program was to improve the patients' 
      symptomatology and their psychosocial functioning, as well as reducing unnecessary 
      medical costs. We treated 172 patients with somatoform disorders (DSM-IV) and 
      compared them with 262 patients of a waiting control list. An additional control 
      group consisted of 123 patients with other mental disorders. Direct and indirect 
      illness-related costs for the two-year periods before and after treatment were 
      re-calculated using objective data provided by the health insurance companies. The 
      results show a marked improvement in the areas of bodily complaints, health 
      anxieties, dysfunctional beliefs towards body and health, depression and 
      psychosocial impairments. The medical costs in the post-treatment period decreased 
      by 1,098 euro (-36.7 %) for inpatient and 382 euro (-24.5 %) for outpatient 
      treatments. Indirect costs due to days lost from work were 6,702 euro (-35.3 %) 
      lower than during the two-years before treatment. The treatment costs had amortized 
      after 21.5 months. We identified a subgroup of high-utilizing somatoform patients 
      for which per patient savings of 32,174 euro (-63.9 %) were found. These results 
      confirm that the cognitive-behavioral approach is effective in improving complaints 
      as well as reducing the health-economical burden of somatoform disorders.

TI  - Epidemiology and treatment of hypochondriasis.
PG  - 9-22
AB  - Although hypochondriasis has been one of the most durable disease concepts in 
      psychopathology, little is known about its epidemiology and treatment. In this 
      article, we review the last three decades of research into these two aspects of 
      hypochondriasis. According to DSM-IV, hypochondriasis is a distressing preoccupation 
      with the fear or thought, based on physical sensations, that one has a serious 
      disease. The prevalence of hypochondriasis in the general population is unknown; 
      however, studies in primary care suggest that the prevalence in this setting is 
      between 0.8 and 4.5%. There are, at present, no conclusive data about specific risk 
      factors for hypochondriasis, although patients with hypochondriasis have higher 
      rates of anxiety, depressive and other somatoform disorders than patients without 
      the disorder. To date, there have been no studies documenting a genetic or familial 
      predisposition for hypochondriasis, or for somatoform disorders in general. 
      Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown in controlled studies to be efficacious 
      in the treatment of hypochondriasis. Although the evidence is stronger for 
      individual therapy, group cognitive-behavioural therapy may also be useful. Other 
      therapies such as supportive or psychoanalytical psychotherapy may be efficacious 
      for certain patients, but the lack of standardised treatments and controlled studies 
      makes them a less preferable treatment option at present. Little is known about the 
      pharmacological treatment of primary hypochondriasis. The limited number of 
      published studies and the absence of controlled trials make it impossible to be 
      certain of the efficacy of existing medications. On the basis of the available 
      information, however, it appears that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      hold promise for the treatment of this disorder. However, more information is needed 
      for their efficacy to be clearly established.

PG  - 269-74
AB  - Patients with panic attacks (or acute anxiety episodes) often present respiratory 
      symptoms, especially dyspnea. Biological, behavioral and cognitive models of panic 
      attacks are presented. The "false suffocation alarm model" is outlined. Biological 
      and cognitive-behavioral treatments which use, among other techniques, respiratory 
      regulation and hyperventilation, are described. Controlled studies and several 
      meta-analyses show that cognitive-behavioral therapies represent an alternative to 
      anxiolytics and antidepressants in panic attacks with or without agoraphobia, and 
      have long lasting effects, while most of the patients under medication alone relapse

TI  - Panic disorder: a clinical perspective on acute treatment and future research needs.
PG  - 262-4
AB  - Panic disorder is a common disorder for which there are highly effective treatments. 
      Patients usually present for treatment in acute distress and initially have 
      difficulty responding to cognitive behavioral therapies. In contrast there is a high 
      response rate to pharmacologic treatments. Cognitive behavioral techniques can be 
      helpful in facilitating the taper and eventual discontinuation of medication and may 
      play a role in preventing relapse. The disorder appears to have a chronic course 
      requiring maintenance medication for at least six months. Phobic avoidance appears 
      to be primarily a learned response and is best treated with in vivo desensitization.

TI  - [Psychoimmunologic correlation between allergies, panic and agoraphobia].
PG  - 325-45
AB  - The present behavioral medical paper is a contribution to basic research in 
      neuroimmunology. The relationship of panic/agoraphobia and allergy/anaphylaxis 
      (IgE-mediated immediate reaction) is demonstrated and discussed with specific 
      consideration of vasomotor reactions, tachycardia and hyperventilation in panic 
      patients and allergies with anaphylactic reactions. The vegetative symptoms of panic 
      reactions and anaphylaxis showed a high correlative correspondence. 74% of 23 panic 
      and/or agoraphobia patients in a pretest to an epidemiologic study turned out to 
      have an allergic illness that needed treatment; but there were no more anxiety 
      disorders disclosed in 50 allergic patients than in the general population according 
      to expectancies found in epidemiologic publications. If these data are confirmed 
      then panic and agoraphobia cannot be seen as merely a cognitive-emotional event, but 
      also as a further kind of allergic disease with genetic, ecological, psychological 
      and social determinants; they would then have to be diagnosed as psychoimmunological 
      disturbances and treated with behavior medicine (preferably with exposition and 
      immunotherapy or hyposensitization). Anxiety therapies would improve qualitatively 
      and could be cut down in duration.

TI  - Quality of life in panic disorder: looking beyond symptom remission.
PG  - 945-59
LID - 10.1007/s11136-011-0020-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Panic Disorder (PD) is a classic example of a disease where symptom 
      remission may be achieved, yet patient quality of life (QOL) remains low, providing 
      further support for the need to measure QOL as an additional outcome in patient 
      care. The objectives of this review are to examine the substantial QOL impairments 
      in PD and to determine whether modern treatments for PD, which have been proven to 
      achieve symptom remission, have been shown to restore QOL. METHODS: We identified 
      studies on QOL in PD from 1980 to 2010 by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed 
      databases. RESULTS: The literature reveals substantial QOL impairments in PD, often 
      resulting in poor sense of health, frequent utilization of medical services, 
      occupational deficiency, financial dependency, and marital strife. Modern therapies 
      have been demonstrated to achieve symptom remission and improve QOL in PD; however, 
      post-treatment QOL is still significantly lower than community averages. 
      CONCLUSIONS: QOL needs to be added as an essential outcome measure in patient care. 
      Further research should be conducted to better understand the nature of 
      comorbidities in PD as well as to determine whether additional interventions that 
      have been studied in other psychiatric disorders, such as exercise, meditation, 
      yoga, humor, massage, and nutritional supplements, can be utilized to improve QOL in 
      PD to normal community levels.

TI  - Study protocol: a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of therapist 
      guided internet-delivered cognitive therapy (TG-iConquerFear) with augmented 
      treatment as usual in reducing fear of cancer recurrence in Danish colorectal cancer 
      survivors.

LID - 223
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive therapy has been shown to reduce fear of cancer recurrence 
      (FCR), mainly in breast cancer survivors. The accessibility of cognitive behavioural 
      interventions could be further improved by Internet delivery, but self-guided 
      interventions have shown limited efficacy. The aim of this study is to test the 
      efficacy of a therapist guided internet-delivered intervention (TG-iConquerFear) vs. 
      augmented treatment as usual (aTAU) in Danish colorectal cancer survivors. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: A population-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing 
      TG-iConquerFear with aTAU (1:1) in n = 246 colorectal cancer survivors who suffer 
      from clinically significant FCR (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory Short Form 
      (FCRI-SF) ≥ 22 and semi-structured interview). Evaluation will be conducted at 
      2 weeks, 3 and 6 months post-treatment and between-group differences will be 
      evaluated. Long-term effects will be evaluated after one year. Primary outcome will 
      be post-treatment FCR (FCRI-SF). Secondary outcomes are global overall health and 
      global quality of life (Visual Analogue Scales 0-100), bodily distress syndrome (BDS 
      checklist), health anxiety (Whiteley-6), anxiety (SCL4-anx), depression (SCL6-dep) 
      and sickness absence and health expenditure (register data). Explanatory outcomes 
      include: Uncertainty in illness (Mishels uncertainty of illness scale, short form, 
      MUIS), metacognitions (MCQ-30 negative beliefs about worry subscale), and perceived 
      risk of cancer recurrence (Visual analogue Scale 1-100). DISCUSSION: This RCT will 
      provide valuable information on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 
      TG-iConquerFear vs. aTAU for CRC survivors with clinical FCR, as well as explanatory 
      variables that may act as outcome moderators or mediators. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Elevated Plus Maze Test Combined with Video Tracking Software to Investigate the 
      Anxiolytic Effect of Exogenous Ketogenic Supplements.
LID - 10.3791/58396 [doi]
AB  - The overall goal of this study is to describe the methodology of the elevated plus 
      maze (EPM) test in combination with a video tracking software. The purpose of the 
      method is to document the effect of various potential anxiolytic treatments on 
      laboratory rodent models. The EPM test is based on the rodents' proclivity toward 
      protected, enclosed dark spaces and unconditioned fear of open spaces and heights, 
      and their innate intense motivation to explore novel environments. The EPM test is a 
      widely used behavioral test for investigating the anxiolytic or anxiogenic responses 
      of rodents given drugs that are known to affect behavior. Observation demonstrating 
      a decreased proportion of time spent on closed arms, an increased proportion of time 
      spent on open arms, a reduced number of entries to closed arms, and an elevated 
      number of entries to open arms measured by the EPM test may reflect reduced anxiety 
      levels. Using this method, the effect of exogenous ketone supplements on 
      anxiety-related behavior is tested in Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats. Exogenous ketone 
      supplements are chronically fed to the rats for 83 days or subchronically and 
      acutely orally gavaged, daily for 7 days, before conducting the EPM test. Behavioral 
      data collection is performed using the SMART video tracking system by a blinded 
      observer at the end of the treatments. The main findings indicate that the EPM test 
      is an effective method to detect the ketone supplement-induced anxiolytic effect and 
      can be considered a sensitive measure to assess changes in anxiety behavior 
      associated with drug- or metabolic-based therapies.

      Directions.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1007/s11920-018-0910-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the 
      efficacy, limitations, and future of e-health treatments for anxiety. Within this, 
      we provide detail on "first-generation" e-health approaches, such as computerized 
      therapies. Additionally, we assess the emergence and early efficacy of newer methods 
      of treatment delivery, including smartphone apps and virtual reality interventions, 
      discussing the potential and pitfalls for each. RECENT FINDINGS: There is now 
      substantial clinical research demonstrating the efficacy of internet-delivered 
      cognitive behavioral therapy in the treatment of anxiety. However, the ability of 
      these interventions for engaging patients in "real-world" settings is unclear. 
      Recently, smartphone apps for anxiety have presented a more popular and ubiquitous 
      method of intervention delivery, although the evidence base supporting these newer 
      approaches drastically falls behind the extensive marketing and commercialization 
      efforts currently driving their development. Meanwhile, the increasing availability 
      of novel technologies, such as "virtual reality" (VR), introduces further potential 
      of e-health treatments for generalized anxiety and anxiety-related disorders such as 
      phobias and obsessive compulsive disorder, while also creating additional challenges 
      for research. Although still in its infancy, e-health research is already presenting 
      several promising avenues for delivering effective and scalable treatments for 
      anxiety. Nonetheless, several important steps must be taken in order for academic 
      research to keep pace with continued technological advances.

AB  - The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is unique in requiring two agonists to 
      bind simultaneously to open its cation channel: the neurotransmitter, glutamate, and 
      the coagonists, glycine, or d-serine. The Snyder laboratory was the first to clone 
      serine racemase (SR), the enzyme that synthesizes d-serine, and to localize it 
      immunocytochemically. Our laboratory has focused on the role of d-serine in brain 
      disorders. Silencing the expression of SR, a risk gene for schizophrenia (SCZ), in 
      mice (SR-/-), results in a phenotype that closely resembles SCZ including: cortical 
      atrophy, reduced dendritic spine density and complexity, downregulation of 
      parvalbumin-positive cortical GABAergic neurons, and cognitive impairments. This 
      pathology can be reversed by treatment of SR-/- mice with d-serine in adulthood. 
      SR-/- mice also exhibit abnormal response toward abusable substances, such as 
      stimulants. They show reduced behavioral sensitization to d-amphetamine, but fail to 
      extinguish it. Place preference to cocaine is altered, and the hedonic response to 
      it is profoundly impaired as assessed by intracranial self-stimulation. 
      d-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the NMDAR glycine modulatory site, shows 
      therapeutic benefit for treating pathologic anxiety in combination with behavioral 
      therapies. Studies in vitro with cortical culture and in vivo with middle cerebral 
      artery occlusion show that silencing SR provides substantial protection against 
      ischemic neuronal death. Finally, the switch of SR expression from neurons to 
      reactive astrocytes after closed head trauma accounts for the reduced in vivo 
      neuroplasticity, electroencephalogram abnormalities, and cognitive impairments.

PG  - 6700-6711
LID - 10.1007/s12035-018-0869-3 [doi]
AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that may develop after 
      exposure to exceptionally threatening or unescapable horrifying events. Actual 
      therapies fail to alleviate the emotional suffering and cognitive impairment 
      associated with this disorder, mostly because they are ineffective in treating the 
      failure to extinguish trauma memories in a great percentage of those affected. In 
      this review, current behavioral, cellular, and molecular evidence supporting the use 
      of cotinine for treating PTSD are reviewed. The role of the positive modulation by 
      cotinine of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and their downstream 
      effectors, the protection of astroglia, and the inhibition of microglia in the PTSD 
      brain are also discussed.

TI  - Fatigue in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy: a qualitative study of people's 
      experiences.
PG  - 1840-1846
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2016.1212109 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this article is to describe how fatigue affects the lives of 
      people with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), how they experience fatigue, and 
      how they deal with it in order to attune rehabilitation care to patients' needs. 
      METHOD: A qualitative study, consisting of 25 semistructured interviews with 
      patients with FSHD and severe fatigue (as measured with the checklist individual 
      strength (CIS) fatigue questionnaire), was conducted to gain insight into the 
      experiences of patients with fatigue. Data were inductively analyzed. RESULTS: 
      Patients describe fatigue as an overwhelming and unpredictable experience and they 
      make a distinction between actual experienced fatigue and fear of becoming tired. 
      Fatigue can, according to patients, be the result of weak muscles, physical 
      overachieving or underachieving and stress. But most of the time patients do not 
      know the actual causes of the fatigue, which makes it hard to deal with. The 
      experienced fatigue has a large impact on participation, social contacts, and the 
      quality of life of patients, and patients try to use many strategies to adapt 
      themselves to the constantly changing situations. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is a severe 
      problem in FSHD and has a huge impact on patients' lives. Patients should be helped 
      to reduce fatigue, for instance by offering evidence-based therapies such as aerobic 
      exercise training or cognitive behavioral therapy. Implications for Rehabilitation 
      Fatigue has significant influence on the quality of lives and participation of 
      people with FSHD. Patients with FSHD are insufficient supported in coping with their 
      fatigue. More attention for fatigue in patients with FSHD in rehabilitation is 
      needed, for instance by a broader implementation of aerobic exercise training or 
      cognitive behavioral therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pain is a disease by itself and it's a public health concern of major 
      implication in children, not just because of the emotional component of the child 
      and his family, but also due to the potential morbidity and mortality involving it. 
      A proper assessment of pain it's a challenge in the pediatric population, due to 
      their lack of understanding and verbalization of hurt. Additionally, a satisfactory 
      treatment of pediatric pain can be arduous due to a lack of clinical knowledge, 
      insufficient pediatric research, and the fear to opioid side effects and addiction. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to address the current definitions of pain, 
      its physiological mechanisms and the consequences of its inadequate management, as 
      well as, to guide the clinicians in the assessment and management of pain in the 
      pediatric population at otolaryngology services. METHODOLOGY: Narrative review by 
      selective MeSH search terms: Children, Pediatrics, Otolaryngology, Pain measurement, 
      Pain Management, Analgesics and Analgesia, from databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, 
      ISI, Current Contents, Scielo and LILACS, between January 2000 and May 2016. 
      RESULTS: 129 articles were reviewed according to the requirements of the objectives. 
      Pain measurement is a challenge in children as there are no physical signs that 
      constitute an absolute or specific indicator of pain, and its diagnosis must rely on 
      physiological, behavioral and self-report methods. Regarding treatment, a suitable 
      alternative are the non-pharmacological cognitive/behavioral therapies helped by 
      pharmacological therapies tailored to the severity of pain and the child's age. We 
      provide evidence-based recommendations on pain treatment, including non-opioid 
      analgesics, opioid analgesics and adjuvant medicines to improve the management of 
      pain in children in otolaryngology services. CONCLUSIONS: We present a global review 
      about assessment and management of pain in pediatric otolaryngology, which leads to 
      future specific reviews on each topic. Research gaps on pain assessment and 
      pharmacological interventions in neonates, infants and children are very wide and it 
      should be promoted ethical and safe research on pain control in this population.

PG  - 218-225

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent and has an impact on the 
      physical and behavioral health of children. Adenotonsillectomy (AT), the primary 
      treatment, is subject to unexplained variation in utilization, which may be reduced 
      by improving physician-patient communication and decision quality for this elective 
      procedure. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors are associated with parental experience 
      and decision making in pediatric SDB and AT surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: In this qualitative study, parents of children with prior SDB 
      evaluation participated in semistructured, audiorecorded interviews. Open-ended 
      questions regarded experiences of having a child with SDB, communication with 
      pediatric clinicians and surgeons, and experiences with AT surgery. Recordings were 
      transcribed and analyzed for emergent themes using grounded theory methodology. 
      Eleven parents of children ages 2 to 17 years who had previously been diagnosed or 
      treated for SDB were identified via purposive sampling and interviewed between 
      January and April 2015. Interviews were conducted at locations convenient for the 
      participants and separate from the pediatric clinic. A goal of this study was to 
      ascertain how parents perceived sharing decisions with their physicians. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Themes of parental experiences and treatment decision-making 
      processes with pediatric SDB. RESULTS: Overarching themes were inclusive of (1) 
      clinical factors of SDB and AT and (2) clinician interpersonal behaviors and 
      communication. Parents described an urgency that led them to seek evaluation or 
      treatment, including fear that the child would stop breathing, or behavioral and/or 
      cognitive delays. Parents often viewed surgery as a "last resort" and had explored 
      alternate therapies prior to seeing the surgeon. Nearly all parents feared 
      anesthesia more than AT surgery itself. Parents described satisfaction when 
      physicians provided them with options, engaged their child in conversation, depicted 
      SDB visually, and were responsive or accessible to questions. Parents regarded a 
      trusting relationship with their pediatrician, confidence in the surgeon, and 
      inclusion in decision making as important. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While clinical 
      factors were influential for decision making, interpersonal factors helped parents 
      feel comfortable and influenced their overall experience. Shared decision making, in 
      which parents receive evidence-based information allowing them to accurately 
      perceive risks, benefits, and alternatives about SDB treatment in the setting of 
      trusting clinician-family relationships, may reduce parental decision conflict and 
      improve decision quality toward AT surgery.

TI  - Stress and Memory: A Selective Review on Recent Developments in the Understanding of 
      Stress Hormone Effects on Memory and Their Clinical Relevance.
LID - 10.1111/jne.12353 [doi]
AB  - Stress causes a neuroendocrine response cascade, leading to the release of 
      catecholamines and glucocorticoids (GCs). GCs influence learning and memory by 
      acting on mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors. Typically, GCs 
      enhance the consolidation of memory processing at the same time as impairing the 
      retrieval of memory of emotionally arousing experiences. The present selective 
      review addresses four recent developments in this area. First, the role of the 
      endocannabinoid system in mediating the rapid, nongenomic effects of GCs on memory 
      is illustrated in rodents. Subsequently, studies on the impact of the selective 
      stimulation of MRs on different memory processes in humans are summarised. Next, a 
      series of human experiments on the impact of stress or GC treatment on fear 
      extinction and fear reconsolidation is presented. Finally, the clinical relevance of 
      the effects of exogenous GC administration is highlighted by the description of 
      patients with anxiety disorders who demonstrate an enhancement of extinction-based 
      therapies by GC treatment. The review highlights the substantial progress made in 
      our mechanistic understanding of the memory-modulating properties of GCs, as well as 
      their clinical potential.

TI  - Cognitive Functional Therapy for Disabling Nonspecific Chronic Low Back Pain: 
      Multiple Case-Cohort Study.
PG  - 1478-88
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20140406 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple dimensions across the biopsychosocial spectrum are relevant in 
      the management of nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). Cognitive functional 
      therapy is a behaviorally targeted intervention that combines normalization of 
      movement and abolition of pain behaviors with cognitive reconceptualization of the 
      NSCLBP problem while targeting psychosocial and lifestyle barriers to recovery. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of cognitive 
      functional therapy for people with disabling NSCLBP who were awaiting an appointment 
      with a specialist medical consultant. DESIGN: A multiple case-cohort study (n=26) 
      consisting of 3 phases (A1-B-A2) was conducted. METHODS: Measurement phase A1 was a 
      baseline phase during which measurements of pain and functional disability were 
      collected on 3 occasions over 3 months for all participants. During phase B, 
      participants entered a cognitive functional therapy intervention program involving 
      approximately 8 treatments over an average of 12 weeks. Finally, phase A2 was a 
      12-month, no-treatment follow-up period. Outcomes were analyzed using 
      repeated-measures analysis of variance or Friedman test (with post hoc Bonferroni 
      correction) across 7 time intervals, depending on normality of data distribution. 
      RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in both functional disability and pain 
      were observed immediately postintervention and were maintained over the 12-month 
      follow-up period. These reductions reached clinical significance for both disability 
      and pain. Secondary psychosocial outcomes, including depression, anxiety, back 
      beliefs, fear of physical activity, catastrophizing, and self-efficacy, were 
      significantly improved after the intervention. LIMITATIONS: The study was not a 
      randomized controlled trial. Although primary outcome data were self-reported, the 
      assessor was not blinded. CONCLUSIONS: These promising results suggest that 
      cognitive functional therapy should be compared with other conservative 
      interventions for the management of disabling NSCLBP in secondary care settings in 
      large randomized clinical trials.

AB  - Even though nociceptive pathology has often long subsided, the brain of patients 
      with chronic musculoskeletal pain has typically acquired a protective 
      (movement-related) pain memory. Exercise therapy for patients with chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain is often hampered by such pain memories. Here the authors 
      explain how musculoskeletal therapists can alter pain memories in patients with 
      chronic musculoskeletal pain, by integrating pain neuroscience education with 
      exercise interventions. The latter includes applying graded exposure in vivo 
      principles during exercise therapy, for targeting the brain circuitries orchestrated 
      by the amygdala (the memory of fear centre in the brain). Before initiating exercise 
      therapy, a preparatory phase of intensive pain neuroscience education is required. 
      Next, exercise therapy can address movement-related pain memories by applying the 
      'exposure without danger' principle. By addressing patients' perceptions about 
      exercises, therapists should try to decrease the anticipated danger (threat level) 
      of the exercises by challenging the nature of, and reasoning behind their fears, 
      assuring the safety of the exercises, and increasing confidence in a successful 
      accomplishment of the exercise. This way, exercise therapy accounts for the current 
      understanding of pain neuroscience, including the mechanisms of central 
      sensitization.

AB  - Attendees have reported changing from being fearful to serene, from listless to 
      energized, from disengaged to connected, and becoming markedly less anxious in a few 
      weeks. Anecdotally, self-reported stress levels have been reduced by over 50% after 
      just one class. Attendees learn not to be afraid of their feelings by working with 
      emotions in a playful manner. When a person can act angry, but separate himself from 
      his personal story, the emotional energy exists in a separate form that is not 
      attached to specific events, and can be more easily dealt with and neutralized. 
      Attendees are taught to "take out the emotional trash" through expressive comedy. 
      They become less intimated by their own emotional intensity and triggers as they 
      learn how even metaphorical buckets of anger, shame, guilt and hurt can be 
      emotionally emptied. The added benefit is that this is accomplished without the 
      disclosure of personal information of the requirement to reexperience past pain 
      which can trigger its own cascade of stress.

LID - 10.1111/nyas.12287 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting as many as 
      10% of youth, with diagnoses peaking during adolescence. A core component of these 
      disorders is an unremitting fear in the absence of present threat. One of the most 
      commonly used therapies to treat these disorders is exposure-based cognitive 
      behavioral therapy that identifies the source of the fear and anxiety and then 
      desensitizes the individual to it. This treatment builds on basic principles of 
      fear-extinction learning. A number of patients improve with this therapy, but 40-50% 
      do not. This paper provides an overview of recent empirical studies employing both 
      human imaging and cross-species behavioral genetics to examine how fear regulation 
      varies across individuals and across development, especially during adolescence. 
      These studies have important implications for understanding who may be at risk for 
      anxiety disorders and for whom and when during development exposure-based therapies 
      may be most effective.

AB  - One of the earliest and most consistent findings in behavioral neuroscience research 
      is that learning changes the brain. Here we consider how learning as an aspect of 
      coping in the context of stress exposure induces neuroadaptations that enhance 
      emotion regulation and resilience. A systematic review of the literature identified 
      15 brain imaging studies in which humans with specific phobias or post-traumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD) were randomized to stress exposure therapies that diminished 
      subsequent indications of anxiety. Most of these studies focused on functional 
      changes in the amygdala and anterior corticolimbic brain circuits that control 
      cognitive, motivational, and emotional aspects of physiology and behavior. 
      Corresponding structural brain changes and the timing, frequency, and duration of 
      stress exposure required to modify brain functions remain to be elucidated in future 
      research. These studies will advance our understanding of coping as a learning 
      process and provide mechanistic insights for the development of new interventions 
      that promote stress coping skills.

TI  - The effectiveness of interventions to reduce anxiety, claustrophobia, sedation and 
      non-completion rates of patients undergoing high technology medical imaging.
PG  - 1122-1185
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced, high technology medical imaging, such as Computed Tomography 
      (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and 
      Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), have seen significant increases 
      in their use. A number of interventions have been developed with the aim of reducing 
      anxiety, fear and claustrophobia prior to and during imaging. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine the effectiveness of interventions aiming to improve the patient 
      experience of high technology medical imaging. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Any patients who 
      have undergone high technology (MRI, CT, PET, Nuclear medicine and SPECT) imaging in 
      a medical imaging department. Interventional scans were not considered for 
      inclusion.Considered interventions were: MRI scanner designs, quieter machines, 
      information, psychological support, anxiety reduction protocols, mock MRI, team 
      training, prone scanning, audiovisual (AV) systems, cognitive behavioural therapies, 
      fragrance administration, guided imagery, patient positioning devices and paediatric 
      preparation booklets.Experimental and observational studies were included in the 
      review.Primary patient outcomes:Secondary patient outcome measures included: SEARCH 
      STRATEGY: A comprehensive, three-step search strategy conducted during August to 
      October 2011 aimed to find both published and unpublished English language studies 
      across 14 major databases. No time restrictions. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Retrieved 
      papers were assessed by two independent reviewers prior to inclusion in the review 
      using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute 
      Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). DATA 
      COLLECTION: Data was extracted from papers included in the review using the 
      standardised data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: Quantitative 
      data was, where possible pooled in statistical meta-analysis using JBI-MAStARI. All 
      results were subject to double data entry. RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies met the 
      inclusion criteria and were considered to be of suitable methodological quality. The 
      quality of the studies varied; however, all the studies included had at a minimum a 
      comparison group. Of the final 38 studies, 29 assessed interventions for MRI, 8 
      Nuclear Medicine procedures, and one in CT. Meta-analysis was performed for two 
      interventions; additional information and an AV system.Significantly fewer children 
      (10-18 years) required sedation prior to a MRI scan when given an audiovisual 
      intervention (n=1785) OR 0.42% (CI 0.25 - 0.70), compared with the control group. 
      Open MRI, newer MRI scanners, quieter machines, information in combination with 
      psychological support or an anxiety reduction protocol, mock MRI, team training, 
      prone scanning, AV systems, cognitive behavioural therapies, fragrance 
      administration, guided imagery, patient positioning devices and paediatric 
      preparation booklets were all found to have some positive effect on at least one 
      outcome, whilst the findings for additional information were mixed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This review identified 38 studies that assessed interventions to reduce anxiety, 
      claustrophobia, sedation and non-completions and improve satisfaction for patients 
      undergoing medical imaging. The majority of the interventions studied had some 
      positive effect on at least one outcome.Healthcare professionals need to be aware of 
      the potential for patients undergoing medical imaging to experience anxiety, fear 
      and claustrophobia during scanning. A number of interventions can be selected and 
      tailored to the patient group.There is still a significant amount of research 
      required to establish the effectiveness for a number of interventions aimed to 
      reduce anxiety, fear and claustrophobia in medical imaging, particularly in CT.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To assess recent research in psychotherapies for the elderly. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: There is preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy in panic disorder, and problem-solving therapy in 
      depression with cognitive impairment. Significant advances have been made showing 
      the benefits of cognitive-behaviour therapy in the medically ill. Examples of public 
      and private psychotherapy services are also described. SUMMARY: There remain many 
      virgin territories awaiting exploration. Psychotherapists and researchers working 
      with the elderly are encouraged to report case studies and to embark on randomized 
      controlled trials. Cognitive-behaviour therapy is the dominant paradigm, but other 
      therapies, such as interpersonal psychotherapy and brief psychodynamic 
      psychotherapy, are also worthy of further study.

TI  - Reestablishment of hope as an intervention for a patient with cystic fibrosis 
      awaiting lung transplantation.
PG  - 1007-10
LID - 10.1089/acm.2010.0107 [doi]
AB  - Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience a progressive deterioration in health 
      leading to a shortened life expectancy with concomitant psychologic challenges that 
      also may require intervention. Approaches to address psychologic dysfunction include 
      insight-oriented therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, hypnosis, 
      massage, music therapy, relaxation, and family therapy. Patients who learn to use 
      coping strategies are more likely to adhere to treatment, which helps improve both 
      their physical and psychologic well-being. Unique stressors arise for patients 
      awaiting lung transplant as a result of their advanced state of disease along with 
      their fear of death before donor lungs become available. This case report 
      demonstrates some of the psychologic struggles faced by a 10-year-old with CF as he 
      awaited lung transplantation, which led to a loss of hope and his request for 
      withdrawal of care. Encouraging of the patient to express how his life might be 
      improved yielded changes in his management that restored his hopefulness, and 
      allowed him to survive long enough to undergo successful lung transplantation. Thus, 
      reestablishment of hope might be studied as an additional intervention to help 
      improve the well-being of patients who are seriously ill.

TI  - Combined Pharmacotherapy and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety Disorders: 
      Medication Effects, Glucocorticoids, and Attenuated Treatment Outcomes.
PG  - 91-103
AB  - Despite the success of both pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioral interventions for 
      the treatment of anxiety disorders, the combination of these modalities in adults 
      has not resulted in substantial improvements in outcome relative to either strategy 
      alone, raising questions about whether there are interfering effects that attenuate 
      the magnitude of combination treatment benefits. In this article, we introduce an 
      accounting of potential interference effects that expands upon arguments asserting 
      the necessity of arousal for successful fear exposure. Specifically, recent advances 
      in the study of the effects of cortisol on memory--suggesting that glucocorticoids 
      are crucial to the learning of emotional material--have led us to posit that the 
      attenuation of glucocorticoid activity by anxiolytic medications may interfere with 
      extinction learning in exposure-based therapies. Implications for the efficacy of 
      combination treatments for the anxiety disorders are discussed.

TI  - Routine outcome monitoring in the Netherlands: practical experiences with a 
      web-based strategy for the assessment of treatment outcome in clinical practice.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1002/cpp.696 [doi]
AB  - Routine outcome monitoring (ROM) is a method devised to systematically collect data 
      on the effectiveness of treatments in everyday clinical practice. ROM involves 
      documenting the outcome of treatments through repeated assessments. Assistants are 
      employed who perform a baseline assessment comprising a standardized diagnostic 
      interview, administration of rating scales and completion of several self-report 
      measures by the patient. At fixed time intervals, assessments are repeated. 
      Dedicated Web-based software has been developed to assist in this task. ROM informs 
      therapists and patients on the severity of the complaints at intake, and the waxing 
      and waning of symptoms over the course of treatment. Researchers can use ROM for 
      effectiveness research, and managers can use it for benchmarking. The use of ROM for 
      research is illustrated by presenting data on the diagnostic status of patients 
      participating in ROM and data on treatment outcome of a subgroup of patients (with 
      panic disorder) in our database. The results show that implementation of ROM is 
      feasible, and after some initial reservations, most therapists now consider ROM to 
      be a necessary and important adjunct to the clinical treatment. In addition, ROM 
      furthers research as the data can be used to study the phenomenology of psychiatric 
      disorders and the outcome of treatments delivered in everyday practice.

TI  - Impact of alexithymia on treatment outcome: a naturalistic study of short-term 
      cognitive-behavioral group therapy for panic disorder.
PG  - 170-9
LID - 10.1159/000288639 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is often suggested in the literature that alexithymic patients are 
      less responsive to psychotherapy than nonalexithymic patients. However, few 
      empirical studies have examined this issue. Furthermore, it is unclear whether or 
      not alexithymia itself may improve during psychotherapy. METHODS: Fifty-five 
      consecutive outpatients with panic disorder received short-term cognitive-behavioral 
      group therapy (CBGT) and were followed up 6 months later. Nineteen patients (35%) 
      were on concomitant antidepressant medication. Alexithymia was measured using the 
      20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Both completers and intention-to-treat 
      analyses were calculated, taking into consideration the potentially confounding 
      effect of comorbid conditions. RESULTS: Baseline alexithymia did not predict outcome 
      of CBGT, neither at posttreatment nor at follow-up. The presence of comorbid axis I 
      disorders predicted nonresponse at posttreatment but not at follow-up. TAS-20 total 
      scores decreased over time, with the TAS-20 factors 1 (difficulty identifying 
      feelings) and 2 (difficulty describing feelings) decreasing significantly, while 
      factor 3 (externally oriented thinking) remained largely stable. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings are encouraging for cognitive-behavioral therapists working with patients 
      with alexithymia who suffer from panic disorder: CBGT outcome does not appear to be 
      negatively affected by alexithymia, and some alexithymic characteristics may even be 
      reduced following CBGT. Assessing alexithymia at treatment onset may be useful for 
      individually tailoring therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Evaluation of two group therapies to reduce fear of progression in cancer patients.
PG  - 471-9
LID - 10.1007/s00520-009-0696-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This paper aims to evaluate the effects of two psychotherapeutic 
      interventions on dysfunctional fear of progression (FoP) in cancer patients and to 
      investigate illness-specific influences. METHODS: One hundred seventy-four cancer 
      patients were recruited from two rehabilitation clinics and randomly assigned to 
      either a four-session cognitive-behavioral group therapy or a 
      supportive-experiential group therapy. The main outcome criterion was FoP that was 
      assessed with the Fear of Progression Questionnaire (FoP-Q) directly before (T1) and 
      after (T2) the intervention, as well as 3 (T3) and 12 months (T4) after discharge. 
      Secondary outcomes were anxiety, depression, and quality of life that were assessed 
      with the following questionnaires: Questions on Life Satisfaction, Questionnaire for 
      General Health Status, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patients from 
      the control group (n = 91) who received treatment as usual were recruited 1 year 
      later with the same inclusion criteria and assessed with the FoP-Q at T1, T2, and 
      T4. RESULTS: Analyses showed a significant main effect for time and a significant 
      interaction for group x time for the main outcome variable. FoP decreased 
      significantly over time in both intervention groups in contrast to the control group 
      that showed only short-term improvements. The interventions were also effective in 
      improving secondary outcomes except general life satisfaction. Analyses of cancer 
      specific influences on FoP indicated a significant influence of disease status, 
      i.e., patients with metastases and recurrence of cancer gained most from the 
      interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of progression, one of the main sources of distress 
      for cancer patients, can be reduced with short psychotherapeutic interventions.

PG  - 393-406
AB  - This study assessed introject and attachment styles of patients and therapists, and 
      the match of these styles in patient/therapist dyads, to determine their relation to 
      various psychotherapy process and outcome measures. The INTREX was used to measure 
      introject style (affiliation and autonomy) and the Relationship Scale Questionaire 
      to measure attachment style (secure, fearful, preoccupied, dismissing). Therapists 
      with more affiliative (self-loving) and secure styles achieve better outcome results 
      compared to therapists with less affiliative (self-hating) and insecure styles. 
      Further, the greater the difference in introject and attachment styles within the 
      patient/therapist dyad, the better the outcome.

TI  - The neuropsychiatry of Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 155-73
AB  - The neuropsychiatry of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its correlates are reviewed. 
      Dementia occurs in up to 30% and can be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. 
      Cognitive impairments involve executive, visuospatial, attentional, and memory 
      dysfunctions. Apathy may respond to dopamine agonists or cholines-terase inhibitors. 
      Cognitive impairment, psychosis, and depression predict quality of life. Visual 
      hallucinations and paranoia are common, and respond to low dose clozapine. 
      Depression is common and predicts caregiver burden and depression. The best data 
      suggest the efficacy of nortriptyline and the safety of SSRIs. Anxiety disorders 
      occur in 40% of patients, especially off-period panic attacks and specific phobias. 
      Bromazepam has proven useful for anxiety in PD, but buspirone has only diminished 
      drug-induced dyskinesias to date. Sleep disorders occur in up to 94% of patients. 
      Insomnia is common and is treated by dopaminergic agent dose reduction, nocturnal 
      dosing, treatment of depression, or use of short half-lived hypnotics, depending on 
      etiology. Parasomnias include REM behavior disorder and vivid dreams and nightmares. 
      Excessive daytime somnolence occurs in at least 15% of patients. Sleep attacks are 
      common and patients should be warned about driving when taking dopamine agonists. 
      Sexual disorders occur in most patients. Paraphilias are associated with dopamine 
      agonists, and clozapine may be useful in their treatment. Surgical therapies are 
      associated with a wide variety of neuropsychiatric features, and vigilance for 
      suicide attempts with subthalamic nucleus stimulation seems warranted. 
      Neuropsychiatric disorders are important determinants of quality of life and 
      caregiver burden in PD. More clinical research is needed to establish effective 
      treatments.

TI  - A cognitive therapy conceptualization of panic disorder exacerbated by interferon 
      treatment.
PG  - 329-37
AB  - This case conference presents a patient with von Willebrand disease, receiving 
      year-long interferon treatment for hepatitis C. She was referred to C-L Psychiatry 
      following a severe exacerbation of panic disorder. Our guest interviewer is Dr. 
      Craig White, a Scottish cognitive therapist. The subsequent discussion outlines the 
      treatment challenges of panic disorder that occurs when a patient is receiving 
      interferon. A literature review evaluates psychological effects of interferon and 
      biological mechanisms by which interferon may exacerbate anxiety and depression. A 
      cognitive therapy conceptualization of interferon-induced exacerbation of panic 
      disorder is proposed.

TI  - A cognitive-behavioral group intervention as prevention for persistent neck and back 
      pain in a non-patient population: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 83-90
AB  - Given the demand for interventions that may prevent the development of persistent 
      musculoskeletal pain problems, we investigated the effects of a cognitive-behavioral 
      program in a group of non-patients with neck or back pain symptoms. Two hundred and 
      fifty-three people selected from a population study were invited to participate. 
      These people had experienced four or more episodes of relatively intense spinal pain 
      during the past year but had not been out of work more than 30 days. Participants 
      were randomly assigned to either a cognitive-behavioral group intervention or a 
      treatment as usual comparison group. The experimental group received a standardized 
      six-session program, provided by a trained therapist according to a manual. A 
      significant overall analysis at the 1-year follow-up showed that the 
      cognitive-behavioral group produced better results on 26 of the 33 outcome 
      variables. Group comparisons indicated that the cognitive-behavioral group, relative 
      to the comparison group, had significantly better results with regard to 
      fear-avoidance beliefs, number of pain-free days, as well as the key variable of 
      sick leave. Participation in the cognitive behavioral group reduced the risk for 
      long-term sick leave during the follow-up by threefold. Thus, despite the strong 
      natural recovery rate for back pain, the cognitive-behavioral intervention produced 
      a significant preventive effect with regard to disability.

TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of panic disorder and 
      agoraphobia.
PG  - S25-30
AB  - This review article summarizes comparator-controlled, short-term studies with 
      currently available selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment 
      of panic disorder and agoraphobia. Fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline 
      and citalopram have all been proven to be superior to pill-placebo in the treatment 
      of panic disorder, agoraphobia and associated symptoms such as depression. Direct 
      comparisons with other antidepressants, benzodiazepines, cognitive-behavioural 
      therapies or combinations of SSRIs with psychotherapeutic interventions are scarce. 
      The majority of studies have reported on fluvoxamine whereas, to date, sertraline 
      and citalopram have been compared only with placebo. Meta-analyses have suggested 
      that combining an antidepressant with exposure in vivo produces the greatest 
      treatment gains. Since this procedure is already commonly used in everyday clinical 
      practice, it is recommended that future research in the treatment of panic disorder 
      be directed towards the investigation of a combination of SSRIs with exposure 
      therapy.

TI  - Psychosocial treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 43-8; discussion 49-51
AB  - This article reviews empirically validated psychosocial treatments for posttraumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD) and considers factors associated with successful therapy 
      outcome. Most of the treatments whose efficacy was studied empirically fall within 
      the broad category of cognitive-behavioral therapy. These include exposure therapy, 
      anxiety management programs, and cognitive therapy. These therapy modalities have 
      been developed to modify conditioned fear and erroneous cognitions that are thought 
      to underlie PTSD. Exposure therapy has the most empirical support because it was 
      found to be effective across different populations of trauma victims with PTSD. 
      Combinations of therapies have also been used, and the value of these is discussed. 
      In addition, this article presents recent evidence about the efficacy of eye 
      movement and desensitization reprocessing. A growing body of evidence supports the 
      use of psychosocial treatments for PTSD, but not all patients benefit. Future 
      research should develop programs that increase the motivation of patients to take 
      advantage of these efficacious treatments.

TI  - Competence of depressed patients for consent to research.
PG  - 1380-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The capacities of depressed patients to consent to research have been 
      questioned by commentators who fear that the cognitive effects of a disorder may 
      impair subjects' abilities to protect their interests. This study used a new 
      instrument for assessing depressed patients' capacities to consent to research and 
      examined their performance, including the relation between severity of depression 
      and extent of impairment. METHOD: Twenty-six female outpatients with major 
      depression (assessed with the Schedule of Affective Disorders and 
      Schizophrenia-Lifetime Version) enrolled in a study of maintenance psychotherapy 
      were recruited for this project. Consent-related abilities were measured with the 
      MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Clinical Research (MacCAT-CR) 1 week after 
      intake and again 8-10 weeks later. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Hamilton 
      Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: Almost all subjects performed quite well on the 
      capacity measures and maintained that level of performance over time. There was no 
      correlation between performance and degree of depressive symptoms and little 
      relation to prior research experience. Some subjects appeared confused about the 
      extent to which decisions about assignment to treatment groups would be made on the 
      basis of their clinical condition rather than randomly. CONCLUSIONS: This outpatient 
      group with major depression showed few impairments in their decision-making 
      capacities related to research. As in other studies, some concerns were raised about 
      subjects' appreciation that treatment assignments would not be individualized for 
      their needs. Examination of hospitalized patients and those with psychotic 
      depression would help to determine whether they show greater degrees of impairment. 
      The MacCAT-CR was easily adapted for use with this depressed group.

TI  - Panic disorder: effective treatment options.
PG  - 2405-12, 2419-20
AB  - Panic disorder is a distressing and debilitating condition with a familial tendency; 
      it may be associated with situational (agoraphobic) avoidance. The diagnosis of 
      panic disorder requires recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and at least one of the 
      following characteristics: persistent concern about having an additional attack 
      (anticipatory anxiety); worry about the implications of an attack or its 
      consequences (e.g., a catastrophic medical or mental consequence) and making a 
      significant change in behavior as a consequence of the attacks. A variety of 
      pharmacologic interventions is available, as are non-pharmacologic cognitive or 
      cognitive-behavioral therapies that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the 
      treatment of panic disorder. Early detection and thoughtful selection of appropriate 
      first-line interventions can help these patients, who often have been impaired for 
      years, regain their confidence and ability to function in society.

TI  - Opioid antagonist affects behavioral effects of exposure in vivo.
PG  - 865-70
AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that endogenous opioids are involved in the 
      extinction of phobic fear through exposure in vivo. Forty-eight spider phobics 
      participated in a 2-hr therapist-directed exposure in vivo treatment. Sixteen Ss 
      were assigned to placebo, 16 to a low dose of naltrexone, and 16 to a high dose of 
      naltrexone. Before intervention, after treatment, and at a 1-wk follow-up test, 
      self-report, physiological, and behavioral measures of phobic fear were completed. 
      At 1-wk follow-up, naltrexone was significantly related, in a dose-dependent way, to 
      a greater relapse on avoidance measures but not on emotional, cognitive, and 
      physiological measures. Endogenous opioids may be specifically involved in the 
      extinction of avoidance behavior but not in the extinction of all aspects of phobic 
      fear.

TI  - Internet-based self-help treatment for panic disorder: a randomized controlled trial 
      comparing mandatory versus optional complementary psychological support.
PG  - 270-86
LID - 10.1080/16506073.2016.1163615 [doi]
AB  - Panic disorder (PD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders. Web-based 
      self-help treatments for PD have had promising results. These online treatments seem 
      to have larger effect sizes (ESs) when professional support is added. However, the 
      amount of support or how it should be administered is not yet clear. The aim of this 
      trial was to study two ways of administering psychological support provided by phone 
      as a part of Internet-based self-help treatment for PD based on cognitive behavioral 
      therapy. Seventy-seven participants diagnosed with PD were randomly assigned to one 
      of three experimental conditions: a waiting list control group; a treatment group 
      with non-scheduled psychological support; or a treatment group with scheduled 
      psychological support. PD symptoms of participants who received treatment improved 
      significantly compared to the control group (mean ES d = 1.18, p < .05). In 
      addition, there were statistically and clinically significant differences between 
      treatment groups (Mean difference = -3.20, p = .005, 95% CI [-5.62, -.79]). The 
      scheduled group showed a larger ES, a lower dropout rate, and better adherence to 
      treatment than the non-scheduled group. Scheduled support seems to be indicated for 
      patients who seek Web-based treatment for PD, and their symptoms of panic, anxiety, 
      and depression improve at post-treatment and six-month follow-up. In contrast, when 
      support depends on patient demand, they receive less support and so, the therapeutic 
      effect is poorer.

TI  - Hypoglycaemia Awareness Restoration Programme for People with Type 1 Diabetes and 
      Problematic Hypoglycaemia Persisting Despite Optimised Self-care (HARPdoc): protocol 
      for a group randomised controlled trial of a novel intervention addressing 
      cognitions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe hypoglycaemia (SH), when blood glucose falls too low to support 
      brain function, is the most feared acute complication of insulin therapy for type 1 
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM). 10% of people with T1DM contribute nearly 70% of all 
      episodes, with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) a major risk factor. People 
      with IAH may be refractory to conventional approaches to reduce SH, with evidence 
      for cognitive barriers to hypoglycaemia avoidance. This paper describes the protocol 
      for the Hypoglycaemia Awareness Restoration Programme for People with Type 1 
      Diabetes and Problematic Hypoglycaemia Persisting Despite Optimised Self-care 
      (HARPdoc) study, a trial to assess the impact on hypoglycaemia experience of a novel 
      intervention that addresses cognitive barriers to hypoglycaemia avoidance, compared 
      with an existing control intervention, recommended by the National Institute of 
      Health and Care Excellence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised parallel two-arm 
      trial of two group therapies: HARPdoc versus Blood Glucose Awareness Training, among 
      96 adults with T1DM and problematic hypoglycaemia, despite attendance at education 
      with or without technology use, in four centres providing specialist T1DM services. 
      The primary outcome will be the SH rate at 12 and/or 24 months after randomisation 
      to either course. Secondary outcomes include rates of SH requiring parenteral 
      therapy, involving unconsciousness or needing emergency services; hypoglycaemia 
      awareness status, overall diabetes control and quality of life measures. An 
      implementation study to evaluate how the interventions are delivered and how 
      implementation impacts on clinical effectiveness is planned as a parallel study, 
      with its own protocol. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the 
      London Dulwich Research Ethics Committee, the Health Research Authority, National 
      Health Service R&D and the Institutional Review Board of the Joslin Diabetes Center 
      in the USA. Study findings will be disseminated to study participants and through 
      peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, including user groups.

TI  - A qualitative study of veterans' mixed emotional reactions to receiving a PTSD 
      diagnosis.
PG  - 687-692
LID - 10.1037/ser0000273 [doi]
AB  - Many veterans do not engage in needed mental health care. To address this problem, 
      we need to understand these patients' experiences from the very start of their care, 
      which includes the assessment and diagnosis process and the communication of that 
      diagnosis to the patient. The patient's reaction to this process can set the tone 
      for the patient's relationship with the mental health system and his or her 
      therapist, yet therapists often receive little training in how to most effectively 
      provide a diagnosis to patients. Prior research has examined emotional reactions to 
      receiving a psychotic spectrum diagnosis, which sometimes included both positive and 
      negative reactions, but to the authors' knowledge, no work has examined reactions to 
      receiving a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. This qualitative study 
      expands upon that work by examining common reactions to receipt of a PTSD diagnosis 
      among low treatment-engaging veterans, changes in that reaction over the first few 
      weeks postdiagnosis, and differences among reactions across veterans who initiate 
      versus refuse evidence-based psychotherapy. Among 50 participants, self-reported 
      reactions were categorized as positive, neutral, and negative. Positive reactions 
      included validation, hope, and proactivity; neutral reactions included confusion, 
      uncertainty, and acceptance; and negative reactions included shock, denial, and fear 
      of stigma. We discuss recommendations for therapists in providing diagnoses in a 
      patient-centered, cognitive-behavioral therapy-consistent way, to maximize the 
      chances of engaging patients into mental health care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

AB  - Pain elicits fear and anxiety and promotes escape, avoidance, and adaptive behaviors 
      that are essential for survival. When pain persists, motivational priority and 
      attention shift to pain-related information. Such a shift often results in impaired 
      functionality, leading to maladaptive pain-related fear and anxiety and escape and 
      avoidance behaviors. Neuroimaging studies in chronic pain patients have established 
      that brain activity, especially in cortical and mesolimbic regions, is different 
      from activity observed during acute pain in control subjects. In this review, we 
      discuss the psychophysiological and neuronal factors that may be associated with the 
      transition to chronic pain. We review information from human studies on neural 
      circuits involved in emotional and motivational pain processing and how these 
      circuits are altered in chronic pain conditions. We then highlight findings from 
      animal research that can increase our understanding of the molecular and cellular 
      mechanisms underlying emotional-motivational pain processing in the brain. Finally, 
      we discuss how translational approaches incorporating results from both human and 
      animal investigations may aid in accelerating the discovery of therapies.

AB  - Microtubule-associated protein tau assists in stabilizing microtubules and has been 
      particularly implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the importance of tau to 
      AD pathogenesis and therapies, it is important to understand non-classic 
      physiological functions for this protein inside and outside the central nervous 
      system (CNS). Our group has previously shown that tau ablation triggers glucose 
      intolerance and pancreatic dysfunction in mice, suggesting that tau plays a role in 
      peripheral metabolic regulation. Little is known about the role of tau in anxiety. 
      Moreover, inconsistent results have been generated regarding the effects of tau 
      deletion in memory. Here, we characterize systemic insulin resistance, 
      anxiety-related behavior and memory in 15 to 20 weeks old Wild-Type (WT), Tau 
      knockout (TauKO) and a distinct hTau mouse model consisting of tau knockout 
      expressing the longest isoform (2N4R) of a non-mutant WT human Tau protein under the 
      prion promoter (hTau). Our findings demonstrate that tau deletion leads to 
      anxiety-related behavior, impaired contextual and cued fear memory. The presence of 
      a human Tau transgene did not ameliorate the phenotypes observed in animals lacking 
      the mouse tau protein and it elicited impairments in learning, memory, and 
      peripheral insulin sensitivity. Our results suggest that tau protein plays a role in 
      memory and anxiety-related behavior. Our findings also indicate that previously 
      unrecognized functions for tau protein may be a complicating factor in using animal 
      models on the TauKO background. Understanding the link between tau pathophysiology 
      and cognitive and metabolic alterations is of great importance to establish the 
      complete contribution of tau protein to AD pathogenesis.

TI  - Clinicians' Perceptions of Behavioral Economic Strategies to Increase the Use of 
      Lung-Protective Ventilation.
PG  - 1543-1549
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201905-410OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Lung-protective ventilation (LPV) improves outcomes in patients with 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has also shown benefits in patients 
      without ARDS. Despite this evidence, LPV use remains low.Objectives: To understand 
      clinicians' perceptions of using behavioral economic strategies to improve rates of 
      LPV use.Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews of clinicians across seven 
      intensive care units within a university health system. We purposefully sampled 
      clinicians of different professional backgrounds and experience levels. Each 
      interview included descriptions of three of five strategies grounded in behavioral 
      economic theory designed to facilitate clinicians' use of LPV: 1) an order set 
      autopopulated with LPV settings ("default"), 2) an order set providing a choice 
      between autopopulated LPV settings and open-ended order entry for alternative 
      settings ("active choice"), 3) requirement of written justification if settings 
      other than LPV were ordered or documented ("accountable justification"), 4) 
      automated ARDS identification and clinician prompting ("alert"), and 5) provision of 
      clinicians' and their peers' individual rates of LPV use ("peer comparison"). 
      Descriptions were followed by open-ended questions to elicit perceptions about 
      advantages, disadvantages, and acceptability. Initial interview transcripts were 
      reviewed by two investigators to develop a thematic codebook, which was refined 
      iteratively with the use of constant comparative methods.Results: We completed 17 
      interviews of physicians, nurse practitioners, and respiratory therapists. 
      Strategies that prepopulated settings (default, active choice, and accountable 
      justification) were perceived as providing benefit by reducing workloads and serving 
      as cognitive prompts. The default and active choice strategies were more acceptable 
      than accountable justification, which was perceived as potentially frustrating due 
      to workflow impedance. The alert strategy was met with concerns about alert accuracy 
      and alarm fatigue. The peer comparison strategy led to concerns about timing and 
      fear of punitive measures. Participants believed that the default and active choice 
      strategies would be highly acceptable, whereas few interviewees thought the alert 
      would be acceptable. The active choice strategy was most consistently identified as 
      potentially highly effective.Conclusions: Behavioral economic strategies have great 
      potential as acceptable and potentially effective strategies to increase the use of 
      LPV.

TI  - Psychological Therapy for Centralized Pain: An Integrative Assessment and Treatment 
      Model.
PG  - 114-124
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000654 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a significant health problem that is increasing in 
      prevalence, and advances in treatment are needed. METHODS: We briefly review the 
      leading evidence-based psychological therapies for chronic pain-cognitive-behavioral 
      and acceptance/mindfulness-based therapies-and examine several limitations and 
      missing perspectives of these approaches. We review six lesser-known interventions 
      that address these limitations, and we describe our integrative model for 
      psychological assessment and treatment of centralized pain. We present a typical 
      patient and describe how we apply this approach, along with challenges to its 
      implementation and possible solutions to these challenges. RESULTS: Greater pain 
      treatment efficacy may be possible if clinicians: (a) distinguish patients with 
      primarily centralized (i.e., somatoform or nociplastic) pain from those with 
      primarily peripheral (nociceptive, inflammatory, or neuropathic) pain; (b) 
      acknowledge the capacity of the brain not only to modulate pain but also generate as 
      well as attenuate or eliminate centralized pain; (c) consider the powerful role that 
      adverse life experiences and psychological conflicts play in centralized pain; and 
      (d) integrate emotional processing and interpersonal changes into treatment. Our 
      integrative treatment involves delivering a progression of interventions, as needed, 
      to achieve pain reduction: tailored pain neuroscience education, cognitive and 
      mindfulness skills to decrease the pain danger alarm mechanism, behavioral 
      engagement in avoided painful and other feared activities, emotional awareness and 
      expression to reverse emotional avoidance and overcome trauma or psychological 
      conflict, and adaptive communication to decrease interpersonal stress. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This integrative assessment and treatment model has the potential to substantially 
      reduce and sometimes eliminate centralized pain by changing the cognitive, 
      behavioral, emotional, and interpersonal processes that trigger and maintain 
      centralized pain.

TI  - Feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of playing Nintendo Wii 
      Fit Plus(TM) for frail older adults: A randomized feasibility clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, interactive video games (IVGs) have been used as a health-care 
      intervention that provides both exercise and cognitive stimulation. Several studies 
      have shown that IVGs can improve postural control, gait, cognition, and functional 
      independence in elderly people and patients with neurological disease. However, 
      there is a lack of evidence about the effects of IVGs on frail and pre-frail elderly 
      people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and 
      acceptability of playing Nintendo Wii Fit Plus(™) (NWFP) interactive video games, 
      and the functional outcomes (postural control, gait, cognition, mood, and fear of 
      falling) in frail and pre-frail older adults. METHODS: This study is a randomized 
      controlled, parallel-group, feasibility trial. Participants were frail and pre-frail 
      older adults randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG, n = 15) or control 
      group (CG, n = 15). Participants in the EG performed 14 training sessions, lasting 
      50 min each, twice a week. In each training session, participants played five of 10 
      selected games, with two attempts at each game. Participants in the CG received 
      general advice regarding the importance of physical activity. All participants were 
      assessed on three occasions by a blinded physical therapist: before and after 
      intervention, and 30 days after the end of the intervention (follow-up). We assessed 
      the feasibility (score of participants in the games), acceptability (game 
      satisfaction questionnaire), safety (adverse events during training sessions), and 
      functional outcomes: (1) postural control (Mini-BESTest); (2) gait (Functional Gait 
      Assessment); (3) cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment); (4) mood (GDS-15); and 
      (5) fear of falling (FES-I). RESULTS: Participants in the EG improved their scores 
      in all 10 games, reported that they understood and enjoyed the tasks of the games, 
      and presented few adverse events during the practice. There was a significant 
      improvement in the Mini-BESTest and Functional Gait Assessment in the EG when 
      compared with the CG (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of NWFP was feasible, 
      acceptable, and safe for frail older adults and improved their postural control and 
      gait. There were no effects on cognition, mood, or fear of falling. This trial was 
      registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-823rst) on 11 June 
      2016.

TI  - An Innovative Framework for Delivering Psychotherapy to Patients With 
      Treatment-Resistant Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Rationale for Interactive 
      Motion-Assisted Therapy.

AB  - Despite an array of evidence-based psychological treatments for patients with a 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a majority of patients do not fully benefit 
      from the potential of these therapies. In veterans with PTSD, up to two-thirds 
      retain their diagnosis after psychotherapy and often their disorder is 
      treatment-resistant, which calls for improvement of therapeutic approaches for this 
      population. One of the factors hypothesized to underlie low response in PTSD 
      treatment is high behavioral and cognitive avoidance to traumatic reminders. In the 
      current paper we explore if a combination of personalized virtual reality, 
      multi-sensory input, and walking during exposure can enhance treatment engagement, 
      overcome avoidance, and thereby optimize treatment effectiveness. Virtual reality 
      holds potential to increase presence and in-session attention and to facilitate 
      memory retrieval. Multi-sensory input such as pictures and music can personalize 
      this experience. Evidence for the positive effect of physical activity on fear 
      extinction and associative thinking, as well as embodied cognition theories, provide 
      a rationale for decreased avoidance by literally approaching cues of the traumatic 
      memories. A dual-attention task further facilitates new learning and 
      reconsolidation. These strategies have been combined in an innovative framework for 
      trauma-focused psychotherapy, named Multi-modular Motion-assisted Memory 
      Desensitization and Reconsolidation (3MDR). In this innovative treatment the 
      therapeutic setting is changed from the face-to-face sedentary position to a 
      side-by-side activating context in which patients walk toward trauma-related images 
      in a virtual environment. The framework of 3MDR has been designed as a boost for 
      patients with treatment-resistant PTSD, which is illustrated by three case examples. 
      The intervention is discussed in context of other advancements in treatment for 
      treatment-resistant PTSD. Novel elements of this approach are activation, 
      personalization and empowerment. While developed for veterans with PTSD who do not 
      optimally respond to standardized treatments, this innovative framework holds 
      potential to also be used for other patient populations and earlier stages of 
      treatment for patients with PTSD.

AB  - Because resources for long-term care services are limited, timely and appropriate 
      referral for rehabilitation services is critical for optimizing clients' functions 
      and successfully integrating them into the community. We investigated which client 
      characteristics are most relevant in predicting Taiwan's community-based 
      occupational therapy (OT) service referral based on experts' beliefs. Data were 
      collected in face-to-face interviews using the Multidimensional Assessment 
      Instrument (MDAI). Community-dwelling participants (n = 221) ≥ 18 years old who 
      reported disabilities in the previous National Survey of Long-term Care Needs in 
      Taiwan were enrolled. The standard for referral was the judgment and agreement of 
      two experienced occupational therapists who reviewed the results of the MDAI. 
      Logistic regressions and Generalized Additive Models were used for analysis. Two 
      predictive models were proposed, one using basic activities of daily living (BADLs) 
      and one using instrumental ADLs (IADLs). Dementia, psychiatric disorders, cognitive 
      impairment, joint range-of-motion limitations, fear of falling, behavioral or 
      emotional problems, expressive deficits (in the BADL-based model), and limitations 
      in IADLs or BADLs were significantly correlated with the need for referral. Both 
      models showed high area under the curve (AUC) values on receiver operating curve 
      testing (AUC = 0.977 and 0.972, respectively). The probability of being referred for 
      community OT services was calculated using the referral algorithm. The referral 
      protocol facilitated communication between healthcare professionals to make 
      appropriate decisions for OT referrals. The methods and findings should be useful 
      for developing referral protocols for other long-term care services.

TI  - Barriers Influencing Linkage to Hypertension Care in Kenya: Qualitative Analysis 
      from the LARK Hypertension Study.
PG  - 304-14
LID - 10.1007/s11606-015-3566-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, the leading global risk factor for mortality, is 
      characterized by low treatment and control rates in low- and middle-income 
      countries. Poor linkage to hypertension care contributes to poor outcomes for 
      patients. However, specific factors influencing linkage to hypertension care are not 
      well known. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate factors influencing linkage to hypertension care 
      in rural western Kenya. DESIGN: Qualitative research study using a modified Health 
      Belief Model that incorporates the impact of emotional and environmental factors on 
      behavior. PARTICIPANTS: Mabaraza (traditional community assembly) participants 
      (n = 242) responded to an open invitation to residents in their respective 
      communities. Focus groups, formed by purposive sampling, consisted of hypertensive 
      individuals, at-large community members, and community health workers (n = 169). 
      APPROACH: We performed content analysis of the transcripts with NVivo 10 software, 
      using both deductive and inductive codes. We used a two-round Delphi method to rank 
      the barriers identified in the content analysis. We selected factors using 
      triangulation of frequency of codes and themes from the transcripts, in addition to 
      the results of the Delphi exercise. Sociodemographic characteristics of participants 
      were summarized using descriptive statistics. KEY RESULTS: We identified 27 barriers 
      to linkage to hypertension care, grouped into individual (cognitive and emotional) 
      and environmental factors. Cognitive factors included the asymptomatic nature of 
      hypertension and limited information. Emotional factors included fear of being a 
      burden to the family and fear of being screened for stigmatized diseases such as 
      HIV. Environmental factors were divided into physical (e.g. distance), socioeconomic 
      (e.g. poverty), and health system factors (e.g. popularity of alternative 
      therapies). The Delphi results were generally consistent with the findings from the 
      content analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Individual and environmental factors are barriers to 
      linkage to hypertension care in rural western Kenya. Our analysis provides new 
      insights and methodological approaches that may be relevant to other low-resource 
      settings worldwide.

AB  - While anxiety disorders are the brain disorders with the highest prevalence and 
      constitute a major burden for society, a considerable number of affected people are 
      still treated insufficiently. Thus, in an attempt to identify potential new 
      anxiolytic drug targets, neuropeptides have gained considerable attention in recent 
      years. Compared to classical neurotransmitters they often have a regionally 
      restricted distribution and may bind to several distinct receptor subtypes. 
      Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that is specifically 
      concentrated in limbic brain areas and signals via at least 5 different 
      G-protein-coupled receptors. It is involved in a variety of physiological processes 
      including the modulation of emotional-affective behaviors. An anxiolytic and 
      stress-reducing property of NPY is supported by many preclinical studies. Whether 
      NPY may also interact with processing of learned fear and fear extinction is 
      comparatively unknown. However, this has considerable relevance since pathological, 
      inappropriate and generalized fear expression and impaired fear extinction are 
      hallmarks of human post-traumatic stress disorder and a major reason for its 
      treatment-resistance. Recent evidence from different laboratories emphasizes a 
      fear-reducing role of NPY, predominantly mediated by exogenous NPY acting on Y1 
      receptors. Since a reduction of fear expression was also observed in Y1 receptor 
      knockout mice, other Y receptors may be equally important. By acting on Y2 
      receptors, NPY promotes fear extinction and generates a long-term suppression of 
      fear, two important preconditions that could support cognitive behavioral therapies 
      in human patients. A similar effect has been demonstrated for the closely related 
      pancreatic polypeptide (PP) when acting on Y4 receptors. Preliminary evidence 
      suggests that NPY modulates fear in particular by activation of Y1 and Y2 receptors 
      in the basolateral and central amygdala, respectively. In the basolateral amygdala, 
      NPY signaling activates inhibitory G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium 
      channels or suppresses hyperpolarization-induced I(h) currents in a Y1 
      receptor-dependent fashion, favoring a general suppression of neuronal activity. A 
      more complex situation has been described for the central extended amygdala, where 
      NPY reduces the frequency of inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents. In 
      particular the inhibition of long-range central amygdala output neurons may result 
      in a Y2 receptor-dependent suppression of fear. The role of NPY in processes of 
      learned fear and fear extinction is, however, only beginning to emerge, and multiple 
      questions regarding the relevance of endogenous NPY and different receptor subtypes 
      remain elusive. Y2 receptors may be of particular interest for future studies, since 
      they are the most prominent Y receptor subtype in the human brain and thus among the 
      most promising therapeutic drug targets when translating preclinical evidence to 
      potential new therapies for human anxiety disorders.

TI  - Cognitive and Guided Mastery Therapies for Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia: 18-Year 
      Long-Term Outcome and Predictors of Long-Term Change.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1002/cpp.1934 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we wished to compare the long-term outcome of (medication-free) panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia patients randomized to cognitive or guided mastery 
      therapy. Thirty-one (67.4%) of 46 patients who had completed treatment were followed 
      up about 18 years after end of treatment. In the combined sample and using 
      intent-to-follow-up analyses, there were large within-group effect sizes of -1.79 
      and -1.63 on the primary interview-based and self-report outcome measures of 
      avoidance of situations when alone, and 56.5% no longer had a panic disorder and/or 
      agoraphobia diagnosis. No outcome differences between the two treatments emerged. 
      Guided mastery was associated with greater beneficial changes in catastrophic 
      beliefs and self-efficacy. For two of five outcome measures, more reduction in 
      panic-related beliefs about physical and mental catastrophes from pre- to 
      post-treatment predicted lower level of anxiety from post-treatment to 18-year 
      follow-up when the effect of treatment changes in (a) self-efficacy and (b) anxiety 
      was controlled. However, for one of the outcome measures, this effect attenuated 
      with time. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: The 
      results suggest that the very-long-term outcome of both cognitive therapy and guided 
      mastery therapy for agoraphobia is positive. The results support the role of 
      catastrophic beliefs as mediator of change. The pattern of results suggests that 
      learning processes other than catastrophic beliefs may be important for long-term 
      outcome as well.

TI  - A comparative effectiveness trial of postoperative management for lumbar spine 
      surgery: changing behavior through physical therapy (CBPT) study protocol.
PG  - 325

AB  - BACKGROUND: The United States has the highest rate of lumbar spine surgery in the 
      world, with rates increasing over 200% since 1990. Medicare spends over $1 billion 
      annually on lumbar spine surgery. Despite surgical advances, up to 40% of patients 
      report chronic pain and disability following surgery. Our work has demonstrated that 
      fear of movement is a risk factor for increased pain and disability and decreased 
      physical function in patients following lumbar spine surgery for degenerative 
      conditions. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and self-management treatments have the 
      potential to address psychosocial risk factors and improve outcomes after spine 
      surgery, but are unavailable or insufficiently adapted for postoperative care. Our 
      research team developed a cognitive-behavioral based self-management approach to 
      postoperative rehabilitation (Changing Behavior through Physical Therapy (CBPT)). 
      Pilot testing of the CBPT program demonstrated greater improvement in pain, 
      disability, physical and mental health, and physical performance compared to 
      education. The current study compares which of two treatments provided by telephone 
      - a CBPT Program or an Education Program about postoperative recovery - are more 
      effective for improving patient-centered outcomes in adults following lumbar spine 
      surgery for degenerative conditions. METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-center, comparative 
      effectiveness trial will be conducted. Two hundred and sixty patients undergoing 
      lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions will be recruited from two medical 
      centers and community surgical practices. Participants will be randomly assigned to 
      CBPT or Education at 6 weeks following surgery. Treatments consist of six weekly 
      telephone sessions with a trained physical therapist. The primary outcome will be 
      disability and secondary outcomes include pain, general health, and physical 
      activity. Outcomes will be assessed preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 
      12 months after surgery by an assessor masked to group allocation. DISCUSSION: 
      Effective rehabilitation treatments that can guide clinicians in their 
      recommendations, and patients in their actions will have the potential to effect 
      change in current clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02184143.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral-based physical therapy to improve surgical spine outcomes: a 
      case series.
PG  - 1130-9
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20120426 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fear of movement is a risk factor for poor postoperative 
      outcomes in patients following spine surgery. The purposes of this case series were: 
      (1) to describe the effects of a cognitive-behavioral-based physical therapy (CBPT) 
      intervention in patients with high fear of movement following lumbar spine surgery 
      and (2) to assess the feasibility of physical therapists delivering 
      cognitive-behavioral techniques over the telephone. CASE DESCRIPTION: Eight patients 
      who underwent surgery for a lumbar degenerative condition completed the 6-session 
      CBPT intervention. The intervention included empirically supported behavioral 
      self-management, problem solving, and cognitive restructuring and relaxation 
      strategies and was conducted in person and then weekly over the phone. 
      Patient-reported outcomes of pain and disability were assessed at baseline (6 weeks 
      after surgery), postintervention (3 months after surgery), and at follow-up (6 
      months after surgery). Performance-based outcomes were tested at baseline and 
      postintervention. The outcome measures were the Brief Pain Inventory, Oswestry 
      Disability Index, 5-Chair Stand Test, and 10-Meter Walk Test. OUTCOMES: Seven of the 
      patients demonstrated a clinically significant reduction in pain, and all 8 of the 
      patients had a clinically significant reduction in disability at 6-month follow-up. 
      Improvement on the performance-based tests also was noted postintervention, with 5 
      patients demonstrating clinically meaningful change on the 10-Meter Walk Test. 
      DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that physical therapists can feasibly implement 
      cognitive-behavioral skills over the telephone and may positively affect outcomes 
      after spine surgery. However, a randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm the 
      results of this case series and the efficacy of the CBPT intervention. Clinical 
      implications include broadening the availability of well-accepted 
      cognitive-behavioral strategies by expanding implementation to physical therapists 
      and through a telephone delivery model.

TI  - Psychological factors in chronic pelvic pain in women: relevance and application of 
      the fear-avoidance model of pain.
PG  - 1542-50
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20100368 [doi]
AB  - Chronic pelvic pain in women is a debilitating, costly condition often treated by 
      physical therapists. The etiology of this condition is multifactorial and poorly 
      understood, given the complex interplay of muscles, bones, and soft tissue that 
      comprise the pelvis. There are few guidelines directing treatment interventions for 
      this condition. In the last decade, several investigators have highlighted the role 
      of psychological variables in conditions such as vulvodynia and painful bladder 
      syndrome. Pain-related fear is the focus of the fear-avoidance model (FAM) of pain, 
      which theorizes that some people are more likely to develop and maintain pain after 
      an injury because of their emotional and behavioral responses to pain. The FAM 
      groups people into 2 classes on the basis of how they respond to pain: people who 
      have low fear, confront pain, and recover from injury and people who catastrophize 
      pain-a response that leads to avoidance/escape behaviors, disuse, and disability. 
      Given the presence of pain-related cognitions in women with chronic pelvic pain, 
      including hypervigilance, catastrophizing, and anxiety, research directed toward the 
      application of the FAM to guide therapeutic interventions is warranted. Isolated 
      segments of the FAM have been studied to theorize why traditional approaches (ie, 
      medications and surgery) may not lead to successful outcomes. However, the explicit 
      application of the FAM to guide physical therapy interventions for women with 
      chronic pelvic pain is not routine. Integrating the FAM might direct physical 
      therapists' clinical decision making on the basis of the pain-related cognitions and 
      behaviors of patients. The aims of this article are to provide information about the 
      FAM of musculoskeletal pain and to provide evidence for the relevance of the FAM to 
      chronic pelvic pain in women.

LID - 10.1007/s11920-010-0128-4 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders, including phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder, are common 
      and disabling disorders that often involve avoidance behavior. Cognitive-behavioral 
      treatments, specifically imaginal and in vivo forms of exposure therapy, have been 
      accepted and successful forms of treatment for these disorders. Virtual reality 
      exposure therapy, an alternative to more traditional exposure-based therapies, 
      involves immersion in a computer-generated virtual environment that minimizes 
      avoidance and facilitates emotional processing. In this article, we review evidence 
      on the application of virtual reality exposure therapy to the treatment of specific 
      phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder and discuss its advantages and cautions.

TI  - Nonpharmacologic management of chronic insomnia.
PG  - 125-30
AB  - Chronic insomnia is highly prevalent in our society, with an incidence of 10 to 30 
      percent. It is a major cost to society in terms of health care expenditure and 
      reduced productivity. Nonpharmacologic interventions have been studied and shown to 
      produce reliable and sustained improvements in sleep patterns of patients with 
      insomnia. Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia has multiple components, including 
      cognitive psychotherapy, sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, 
      paradoxical intention, and relaxation therapy. Cognitive psychotherapy involves 
      identifying a patient's dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, challenging their 
      validity, and replacing them with more adaptive substitutes. Sleep hygiene education 
      teaches patients about good sleep habits. Stimulus control therapy helps patients to 
      associate the bedroom with sleep and sex only, and not other wakeful activities. 
      Sleep restriction therapy consists of limiting time in bed to maximize sleep 
      efficiency. Paradoxical intention seeks to remove the fear of sleep by advising the 
      patient to remain awake. Relaxation therapies are techniques taught to patients to 
      reduce high levels of arousal that interfere with sleep. Cognitive behavior therapy 
      involves four to eight weekly sessions of 60 to 90 minutes each, and should be used 
      more frequently as initial therapy for chronic insomnia.

TI  - Therapist-aided exposure for women with lifelong vaginismus: a replicated 
      single-case design.
PG  - 149-159
LID - 10.1037/a0014273 [doi]
AB  - Vaginismus is commonly described as a persistent difficulty in allowing vaginal 
      entry of a penis or other object. Lifelong vaginismus occurs when a woman has never 
      been able to have intercourse. A replicated single-case A-B-phase design was used to 
      investigate the effectiveness of therapist-aided exposure for lifelong vaginismus. A 
      baseline period (Phase A) was contrasted with exposure + follow-up (Phase B), using 
      random switching between phases. The main outcome measure (intercourse ability) was 
      assessed daily for 24 weeks. Ten women participated. The exposure consisted of a 
      maximum of three 2-hr sessions during 1 week at a university hospital. The 
      participant performed vaginal penetration exercises on herself, in the presence of a 
      female therapist. Two follow-up sessions were scheduled over a 5-week period. Nine 
      of the 10 participants reported having intercourse after treatment, and in 5 of the 
      9, intercourse was possible within the 1st week of treatment. The results remained 
      at 1-year follow-up. Furthermore, exposure was successful in decreasing fear and 
      negative penetration beliefs posttreatment and at 3-month and 1-year follow-ups. 
      Therapist-aided exposure appears to be an effective treatment for lifelong 
      vaginismus.

TI  - Posttraumatic stress disorder: etiology, epidemiology, and treatment outcome.
PG  - 161-97
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) results from exposure to a traumatic event that 
      poses actual or threatened death or injury and produces intense fear, helplessness, 
      or horror. U.S. population surveys reveal lifetime PTSD prevalence rates of 7% to 
      8%. Potential reasons for varying prevalence rates across gender, cultures, and 
      samples exposed to different traumas are discussed. Drawing upon a conditioning 
      model of PTSD, we review risk factors for PTSD, including pre-existing 
      individual-based factors, features of the traumatic event, and posttrauma social 
      support. Characteristics of the trauma, particularly peritraumatic response and 
      related cognitions, and posttrauma social support appear to confer the greatest risk 
      for PTSD. Further work is needed to disentangle the interrelationships among these 
      factors and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Based upon existing treatment 
      outcome studies, we recommend use of exposure therapies and anxiety management 
      training as first-line treatment for PTSD. Among psychopharmacological treatments, 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors evidence the strongest treatment effects, 
      yet these effects are modest compared with psychological treatments.

AB  - The goal of the current review is to examine the evidence for the efficacy of 
      dynamic psychotherapy, primarily focusing on studies that meet the rigorous criteria 
      proposed by Chambless & Hollon (1998). We examine whether any progress has been made 
      over the past decade in evaluating the efficacy of dynamic psychotherapy using 
      well-controlled randomized designs. Over the past decade, multiple studies have been 
      published supporting the efficacy of dynamic psychotherapy for the treatment of 
      specific mental disorders. Dynamic psychotherapy should now be included as a 
      possibly efficacious treatment for panic disorder and borderline personality 
      disorder, as well as the original designation of possibly efficacious in the 
      treatment of opiate dependence. In the context of medication usage, dynamic 
      psychotherapy should be considered efficacious in the treatment of major depressive 
      disorder (MDD). Studies suggest that dynamic psychotherapy has great promise as a 
      monotherapy for MDD and alcohol dependence and thus should be evaluated further.

TI  - Which panic disorder patients benefit from which treatment: cognitive therapy or 
      antidepressants?
PG  - 154-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beliefs about the controllability of a disorder may be relevant in the 
      causation, maintenance and treatment of disorders. We investigated whether 
      congruence between patients' beliefs about controllability of a panic disorder and 
      the type of treatment provided predicted outcome. METHODS: The differential 
      effectiveness of cognitive therapy and antidepressant treatment (paroxetine or 
      clomipramine) was investigated in a sample of 129 panic disorder patients in a 
      12-week, pretest posttest placebo-controlled study. Panic frequency, agoraphobic 
      avoidance, anxiety, depression, and disability were measured with various validated 
      interviewer and self-report measures. Beliefs about controllability were measured 
      with the Multidimensional Anxiety Locus of Control Scale measuring an internal, 
      chance, therapist and medication locus of control. In order to analyze 
      aptitude-treatment interactions a new strategy called the Regression Trunk Approach 
      was used in addition to classical hierarchical multiple regression analysis. 
      RESULTS: Using the Regression Trunk Approach we found that locus of control 
      orientation (LOC) predicted the differential effectiveness of cognitive therapy. 
      Those patients with a medium internal LOC who received cognitive therapy performed 
      significantly better than all patients who received a placebo pill on 8 of the 10 
      outcome variables. We did not find a differential LOC effect for antidepressant 
      treatment. No evidence for aptitude-treatment interactions using hierarchical 
      multiple regression analysis was found. CONCLUSIONS: Moderately strong beliefs about 
      self-control of panic disorder congruent with the cognitive intervention provided 
      seem to moderate treatment effectiveness. Future studies must be more attentive to 
      the nonlinear effects of patient characteristics on the outcome of different types 
      of treatments.

TI  - Fear of flying treatment methods: virtual reality exposure vs. cognitive behavioral 
      therapy.
PG  - 121-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fear of flying (FOF) can be a serious problem for individuals who 
      develop this condition and for military and civilian organizations that operate 
      aircraft. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three 
      treatments: bibliotherapy (BIB) without therapist contact; individualized virtual 
      reality exposure therapy (VRE); and cognitive behavior therapy (CB). In addition, we 
      evaluated the effect of following up VRE and CB with 2 d of group 
      cognitive-behavioral training (GrCB). METHODS: There were 86 subjects suffering from 
      FOF who entered the study; 19 BIB, 29 VRE, and 16 CB subjects completed the 
      treatment protocols. The BIB subjects were then treated with VRE (n = 7) or CB (n = 
      12). There were 59 subjects who were then trained with GrCB. RESULTS: Treatment with 
      VRE or CB was more effective than BIB. Both VRE and CB showed a decline in FOF on 
      the two main outcome measures. There was no statistically significant difference 
      between those two therapies. However, effect sizes were lower for VRE (small to 
      moderate) than for CB (moderate) and the addition of GrCB had less effect for VRE 
      than for CB. DISCUSSION: VRE holds promise as treatment for FOF, but in this trial 
      CB followed by GrCB showed the largest decrease in subjective anxiety. The results 
      suggest that future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness of VRE vs. 
      VRE plus cognitive techniques or measure the effectiveness of each component of 
      treatment. Moreover, the effectiveness of the GrCB as stand-alone treatment should 
      be investigated, which might even be superior in cost-effectiveness.

TI  - A new functional status outcome measure of dyspnea and anxiety for adults with lung 
      disease: the dyspnea management questionnaire.
PG  - 395-404
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and psychometrically test the Dyspnea Management Questionnaire 
      (DMQ), a new multidimensional measure of dyspnea in adults with chronic obstructive 
      lung disease. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-five participants were recruited with diagnoses 
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, n = 73) and asthma (n = 12). The 
      total sample was predominately female (65%) and married (34%), with 64.9% white and 
      a mean age of 75 years (SD = 9.6, n = 76), diagnosed with pulmonary disease 4.8 
      years ago (SD = 4.4), 32% requiring the use of supplemental oxygen. Participants 
      were also African American (29.9%), Asian (2.6%), and Hispanic (2.6%); n = 77. 
      METHODS: An initial item pool of 74 items was drawn for the DMQ aided by qualitative 
      interview data, literature review, and pilot testing with 3 adults with COPD. 
      Several analyses were used to reduce the item pool. An interdisciplinary panel of 12 
      experts evaluated the content validity of the DMQ items. To evaluate test-retest 
      reliability, respondents with stable COPD (n = 26) completed the questionnaire twice 
      within a mean interval of 18 days (SD = 7.17). The DMQ was compared with the Medical 
      Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form (SF-12) Health Survey, the Seattle Obstructive 
      Lung Disease Questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: 
      The resulting DMQ is a 30-item scale that measures 5 conceptually derived 
      dimensions: dyspnea intensity, dyspnea-related anxiety, fearful activity avoidance, 
      self-efficacy for activity, and satisfaction with strategy use. It has a 7-point 
      Likert-type scale and third Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level. A panel of 12 
      experts supported the content validity of the DMQ. It showed high internal 
      consistency (alpha = .87 to .96) and test-retest reliability over 2.5 weeks 
      (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.71 to 0.95). Dyspnea intensity, 
      dyspnea-related anxiety, and fearful activity avoidance subscales of DMQ-30 and 
      composite score were moderately to highly correlated with 3 Seattle Obstructive Lung 
      Disease Questionnaire dimensions (r = 0.44-0.83), Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item 
      Short-Form scales (r = 0.41-0.57), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety 
      (r = -0.59 to -0.65). Two of DMQ's subscales, self-efficacy for activity and 
      satisfaction with strategy use, correlated mildly with Seattle Obstructive Lung 
      Disease Questionnaire (r = 0.28 and 0.27, respectively). Some very low correlations 
      for DMQ-30's satisfaction with strategy use compared with the Medical Outcomes Study 
      12-Item Short-Form provided preliminary support for its divergent construct 
      validity. The DMQ-30 discriminated adults with COPD requiring supplemental oxygen 
      from those not requiring it. CONCLUSIONS: The DMQ addresses the need for a more 
      comprehensive, multidimensional assessment of dyspnea, especially for anxious 
      patients with COPD, in order to better guide the appropriate application of dyspnea 
      management interventions and measure pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes. The DMQ can 
      help add insights into the benefit of adjunctive therapies such as psychoeducation, 
      controlled breathing strategies, and cognitive-behavioral approaches in pulmonary 
      rehabilitation for anxious patients with COPD.

TI  - Anxiety disorders: under-diagnosed and insufficiently treated.
PG  - 3-9
LID - 10.1080/13651500600552297 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders have a high prevalence, particularly specific phobia, social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized 
      anxiety disorder (GAD). The lifetime prevalence for any anxiety disorder is almost 
      30%. Also, many anxiety disorders have a high rate of comorbid depression, which is 
      generally secondary to the anxiety. Despite high prevalence, anxiety disorders are 
      under-diagnosed, misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated. There is a hierarchy in 
      the lifetime probability of treatment contact, with panic and GAD being diagnosed 
      and treated earlier - possibly as a result of these disorders being the most 
      "visible", unlike SAD, which is characteristically discreet. Under-diagnosis is 
      linked with under-treatment: less than one in five patients with an anxiety disorder 
      receive appropriate medication, which improves to almost one in three for subjects 
      with comorbid depression. For the majority of people with undiagnosed or untreated 
      anxiety disorder, there are many negative consequences, for both the individual and 
      society. These include disability, reduced ability to work leading to loss of 
      productivity, and a high risk of suicide. All of these factors contribute to a 
      reduced quality of life. The economic costs associated with anxiety disorders are 
      large - €48 billion over 28 European countries - and similar to those for dementia. 
      Almost half of the costs are indirect, due to loss of productivity and earnings; the 
      remainder being direct medical and non-medical costs. Current first-line therapies 
      are the antidepressive selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with 
      cognitive behavioural therapy a first- or second-line treatment. However, 
      benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed more often than antidepressants. Recent 
      studies have shown that a new type of SSRI, escitalopram (the S-enantiomer of the 
      racemic citalopram), with a unique mode of action, is effective and offers potential 
      as a new treatment for anxiety disorders.

TI  - Distraction for children of different ages who undergo repeated needle sticks.
PG  - 22-34
AB  - A distraction intervention for pain management and behavioral distress was 
      implemented for six children with chronic illnesses and their parents as the 
      children underwent repeated needle sticks. The children ranged in age from two to 
      eight years. Several different cognitive distractors were used for the children 
      based on their respective developmental levels. The needle stick procedures during 
      which treatment was implemented included intramuscular injections, implanted port 
      accesses, and intravenous placements. Nine sessions of distraction were provided in 
      which a therapist taught parents to coach their children to use distraction 
      techniques. Dependent measures included the child's behavioral distress and heart 
      rate, parent ratings of the child's fear before the procedure, parent self-ratings 
      of feeling upset during the procedure, and nurse ratings of the child's cooperation. 
      Reductions in child behavioral distress during the distraction treatment program 
      were observed in five out of the six cases. Concomitant improvements in parental 
      reports of child distress, nurse estimates of child cooperation, and parents' 
      self-report of feeling upset during the medical procedures also were found. 
      Follow-up data were available for one of the successfully treated children. His 
      improvements were maintained for both intramuscular injections and portacatheter 
      accesses over 16 weeks without therapist involvement.

TI  - The pharmacotherapy of panic disorder.
PG  - A54-75
AB  - The biological model for panic disorder posits a specific, genetically inherent 
      neurochemical dysfunction; pharmacological treatment attempts to reregulate the 
      dysregulated physiological system, thereby achieving remission (or, ideally, 
      recovery) or amelioration of the symptoms sufficient for nonpharmacological 
      therapies to be viable. This article will review the evidence of the efficacy of 
      single classes of pharmacological agents (antidepressants, including TCAs, MAOIs, 
      and SSRIs; benzodiazepines; and other agents) and integrated treatments, involving 
      coadministration of medications within or across classes or a combination of 
      pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy. Research pertaining to the relative efficacy of administering combination 
      treatments concurrently or sequentially is examined. Individualized treatment plans 
      for patients maximize the benefits of integrated treatments.

TI  - Panic, agoraphobia, and panic disorder with agoraphobia. Data from a multicenter 
      anxiety disorders study.
PG  - 72-9
AB  - In a cross-sectional investigation of the properties of DSM-III-R panic disorder 
      (PD), panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA), and agoraphobia without history of 
      panic disorder (AWOPD), we analyzed demographic, descriptive, comorbidity, 
      treatment, and course data for 562 subjects with PD, PDA, or AWOPD in a multicenter 
      anxiety-disorders study. In general, AWOPD subjects had the worst functioning and PD 
      subjects the best, as measured by length of intake episodes, education attained, 
      likelihood of receiving financial assistance, depressive comorbidity, and likelihood 
      of having experienced 8 weeks symptom-free. Panic disorder with agoraphobia was the 
      most common disorder and emerged as a condition intermediate in severity between the 
      other two. Treatments received varied little by diagnosis. Most subjects received 
      medication, usually benzodiazepines. Psychodynamic psychotherapy was the most 
      frequently received psychosocial treatment; cognitive and behavioral approaches were 
      less common. Subjects classified with AWOPD were the most likely to have received 
      exposure therapies.
