TI  - Efficacy of treatments for anxiety disorders: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 183-92
LID - 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000078 [doi]
AB  - To our knowledge, no previous meta-analysis has attempted to compare the efficacy of 
      pharmacological, psychological and combined treatments for the three main anxiety 
      disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia). Pre-post 
      and treated versus control effect sizes (ES) were calculated for all evaluable 
      randomized-controlled studies (n = 234), involving 37,333 patients. Medications were 
      associated with a significantly higher average pre-post ES [Cohen's d = 2.02 
      (1.90-2.15); 28,051 patients] than psychotherapies [1.22 (1.14-1.30); 6992 patients; 
      P < 0.0001]. ES were 2.25 for serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (n = 23 
      study arms), 2.15 for benzodiazepines (n = 42), 2.09 for selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (n = 62) and 1.83 for tricyclic antidepressants (n = 15). ES for 
      psychotherapies were mindfulness therapies, 1.56 (n = 4); relaxation, 1.36 (n = 17); 
      individual cognitive behavioural/exposure therapy (CBT), 1.30 (n = 93); group CBT, 
      1.22 (n = 18); psychodynamic therapy 1.17 (n = 5); therapies without face-to-face 
      contact (e.g. Internet therapies), 1.11 (n = 34); eye movement desensitization 
      reprocessing, 1.03 (n = 3); and interpersonal therapy 0.78 (n = 4). The ES was 2.12 
      (n = 16) for CBT/drug combinations. Exercise had an ES of 1.23 (n = 3). For control 
      groups, ES were 1.29 for placebo pills (n = 111), 0.83 for psychological placebos (n 
      = 16) and 0.20 for waitlists (n = 50). In direct comparisons with control groups, 
      all investigated drugs, except for citalopram, opipramol and moclobemide, were 
      significantly more effective than placebo. Individual CBT was more effective than 
      waiting list, psychological placebo and pill placebo. When looking at the average 
      pre-post ES, medications were more effective than psychotherapies. Pre-post ES for 
      psychotherapies did not differ from pill placebos; this finding cannot be explained 
      by heterogeneity, publication bias or allegiance effects. However, the decision on 
      whether to choose psychotherapy, medications or a combination of the two should be 
      left to the patient as drugs may have side effects, interactions and 
      contraindications.

AB  - Anxiety disorders belong to the most frequent psychiatric disorders according to 
      epidemiological studies and are associated with a high economic burden. Panic 
      disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia 
      belong to the most important clinical disorders. The etiology is complex, including 
      genetic, neurobiological as well as psychosocial factors. With regard to treatment, 
      both psychotherapy and medication can be employed according to current treatment 
      guidelines. With regard to psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      represents the treatment of choice. As for pharmacological treatment, in particular 
      modern antidepressants and pregabalin are recommended. However, several 
      recommendations have to be considered in daily clinical practice.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and 
      Pharmacotherapy for Childhood Anxiety Disorders: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1049-1056
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.3036 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Childhood anxiety is common. Multiple treatment options are available, 
      but existing guidelines provide inconsistent advice on which treatment to use. 
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and adverse events of 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy for childhood anxiety 
      disorders. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and SciVerse 
      Scopus from database inception through February 1, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized 
      and nonrandomized comparative studies that enrolled children and adolescents with 
      confirmed diagnoses of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, 
      generalized anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety and who received CBT, 
      pharmacotherapy, or the combination. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Independent 
      reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Random-effects meta-analysis was used 
      to pool data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary anxiety symptoms (measured by 
      child, parent, or clinician), remission, response, and adverse events. RESULTS: A 
      total of 7719 patients were included from 115 studies. Of these, 4290 (55.6%) were 
      female, and the mean (range) age was 9.2 (5.4-16.1) years. Compared with pill 
      placebo, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) significantly reduced 
      primary anxiety symptoms and increased remission (relative risk, 2.04; 95% CI, 
      1.37-3.04) and response (relative risk, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.60-2.40). 
      Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) significantly reduced 
      clinician-reported primary anxiety symptoms. Benzodiazepines and tricyclics were not 
      found to significantly reduce anxiety symptoms. When CBT was compared with 
      wait-listing/no treatment, CBT significantly improved primary anxiety symptoms, 
      remission, and response. Cognitive behavioral therapy reduced primary anxiety 
      symptoms more than fluoxetine and improved remission more than sertraline. The 
      combination of sertraline and CBT significantly reduced clinician-reported primary 
      anxiety symptoms and response more than either treatment alone. Head-to-head 
      comparisons were sparse, and network meta-analysis estimates were imprecise. Adverse 
      events were common with medications but not with CBT and were not severe. Studies 
      were too small or too short to assess suicidality with SSRIs or SNRIs. One trial 
      showed a statistically nonsignificant increase in suicidal ideation with 
      venlafaxine. Cognitive behavioral therapy was associated with fewer dropouts than 
      pill placebo or medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Evidence supports the 
      effectiveness of CBT and SSRIs for reducing childhood anxiety symptoms. 
      Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors also appear to be effective based on 
      less consistent evidence. Head-to-head comparisons between various medications and 
      comparisons with CBT represent a need for research in the field.

TI  - Treatment of Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD) and Related Disorders.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1007/s11940-018-0535-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a newly 
      defined disorder of functional dizziness that in the International Classification of 
      Diseases in its 11th revision (ICD-11) supersedes phobic postural vertigo and 
      chronic subjective dizziness. Despite efforts to unify the diagnosis of functional 
      (somatoform) dizziness, patients will present with a variety of triggers, 
      perpetuating factors, and comorbidities, requiring individualized treatment. This 
      article will review different treatment strategies for this common functional 
      neurological disorder and provide practical recommendations for tailored therapy. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: An emerging understanding of the underlying pathophysiology that 
      considers vestibular, postural, cognitive, and emotional aspects can enable patients 
      to profit from vestibular rehabilitation, as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT). Crucially, approaches from CBT should inform and augment physiotherapeutic 
      techniques, and, on the other hand, vestibular exercises or relaxation techniques 
      can be integrated into CBT programs. Antidepressant medication might further 
      facilitate rehabilitation, though the mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, and the 
      level of evidence is low. In PPPD and related disorders, vestibular rehabilitation 
      combined with CBT, and possibly supported by medication, can help patients escape a 
      cycle of maladaptive balance control, recalibrate vestibular systems, and regain 
      independence in everyday life.

LID - 10.1007/s10803-018-3861-x [doi]
AB  - We examined the feasibility and acceptability of using an immersive virtual reality 
      environment (VRE) alongside cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for young people with 
      autism experiencing specific phobia. Thirty-two participants were randomised to 
      treatment or control. Treatment involved one session introducing CBT techniques and 
      four VRE sessions, delivered by local clinical therapists. Change in target 
      behaviour was independently rated. Two weeks after treatment, four treatment 
      participants (25%) and no control participants were responders; at 6 months after 
      treatment, six (38%) treatment and no control participants were responders. At 
      6 months post-treatment, symptoms had worsened for one treatment and five control 
      (untreated) participants. Brief VRE exposure with CBT is feasible and acceptable to 
      deliver through child clinical services and is effective for some participants.

BTI - Anxiety in Children
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments for 
      childhood anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, 
      specific phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety. DATA 
      SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE(®), Embase(®), PsycINFO(®), Cochrane Central Register 
      of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and SciVerse Scopus 
      through February 1, 2017, and reviewed bibliographies and the gray literature. 
      REVIEW METHODS: We included randomized and non-randomized comparative studies that 
      compared psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination in children ages 3 to 18 
      years with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, generalized 
      anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety. Pairs of independent reviewers selected 
      studies using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: We included 
      206 studies. Compared with pill placebo, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors improved primary anxiety symptoms 
      (moderate to high strength of evidence [SOE]). Tricyclic antidepressants marginally 
      improved clinical response (low SOE). Benzodiazepines did not show significant 
      improvement in primary anxiety symptoms (low SOE). Data on head-to-head comparisons 
      across drugs were sparse (only 2 RCTs; low SOE). Compared with waitlisting or no 
      treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improved primary anxiety symptoms 
      (clinician, child, and parent report), function, remission, and clinical response 
      (low to moderate SOE). Compared with other therapies (attention control or treatment 
      as usual), CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms (child report; moderate SOE). 
      Compared with CBT alone, the combination of imipramine and CBT reduced primary 
      anxiety symptoms (child report) and function (moderate SOE). The combination of 
      sertraline and CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms (clinician report), improved 
      function, and increased clinical response compared with CBT alone or sertraline 
      alone (moderate SOE). CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms and improved function 
      more than fluoxetine, and was more likely to increase remission than sertraline. 
      Medications increased short-term adverse events that were mostly not serious (low or 
      moderate SOE). Studies were too small or too short to assess suicidality with SSRI 
      or SNRI. One trial showed a statistically nonsignificant increase in suicidal 
      ideation with venlafaxine (low SOE). CONCLUSIONS: CBT is effective in reducing 
      anxiety symptoms and improving function. Medications, primarily those targeting 
      serotonin, are also effective and were associated with various short-term adverse 
      events, which were mostly not serious, but studies were too small or too short to 
      assess suicidality with SSRI or SNRI. The combination of medications and CBT is 
      likely more effective than either treatment alone. Comparative effectiveness 
      evidence between various medications and comparing CBT versus medications, or the 
      combination, is limited and represents a need for research in this field. Future 
      research is needed to evaluate components of CBT, effect modifiers of treatment, and 
      long-term safety of drugs, and needs to be more inclusive of underserved populations 
      and minorities.

TI  - Exercise for anxiety disorders: systematic review.
PG  - 187-96
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are commonly treated with antidepressants and 
      psychological treatments. Some patients may prefer alternative approaches such as 
      exercise. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the treatment effects of exercise compared with 
      other treatments for anxiety disorders. DATA SOURCES: Randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of exercise interventions for anxiety disorders were identified by searching 
      six online databases (July 2011). A number of journals were also hand searched. MAIN 
      RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included. For panic disorder: exercise appears to reduce 
      anxiety symptoms but it is less effective than antidepressant medication (1 RCT); 
      exercise combined with antidepressant medication improves the Clinical Global 
      Impression outcomes (1 RCT, p<0.05); exercise combined with occupational therapy and 
      lifestyle changes reduces Beck Anxiety Inventory outcomes (1 RCT, p=0.0002). For 
      social phobias, added benefits of exercise when combined with group cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) were shown (p<0.05). There was no significant difference 
      between aerobic and anaerobic exercise groups (1 RCT, p>0.1) with both seeming to 
      reduce anxiety symptoms (1 RCT, p<0.001). It remains unclear as to which type of 
      exercise; moderate to hard or very light to light, is more effective in anxiety 
      reduction (2 RCTs). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise seems to be effective as an adjunctive 
      treatment for anxiety disorders but it is less effective compared with 
      antidepressant treatment. Both aerobic and non-aerobic exercise seems to reduce 
      anxiety symptoms. Social phobics may benefit from exercise when combined with group 
      CBT. Further well-conducted RCTs are needed.

      Issues.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1007/s11920-019-1010-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper seeks to identify the risk factors of fear of 
      childbirth (FOC) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to birth and 
      reviews the efficacy of their respective screening tools and therapeutic 
      interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Biofeedback, hypnosis, internet-based cognitive 
      behavioral therapy, and antenatal education are promising treatments for FOC. 
      Training midwives to address traumatic birth experiences could help in preventing 
      PTSD. A shorter more pragmatic screening tool for FOC than the Wijma Delivery 
      Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (WDEQ) is needed. Women with PTSD attributed a 
      mismatch between the expected mode of delivery (MOD) and the actual MOD as the cause 
      of their trauma. A history of mental health disorders, lack of social support, 
      previous negative birth experiences, and MOD are correlated to FOC and postpartum 
      PTSD. Psycho-education and CBT-based treatments have been found to reduce levels of 
      FOC and PTSD.

TI  - Comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Systemic Therapy for Social Anxiety 
      Disorder: Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial (SOPHO-CBT/ST).
LID - 10.1111/famp.12492 [doi]
AB  - This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to pilot the newly developed manualized 
      and monitored systemic therapy (ST) for social anxiety disorder (SAD), as compared 
      to manualized and monitored cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We conducted a 
      prospective multicenter, assessor-blind pilot RCT on 38 outpatients (ICD F40.1; 
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID); Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, 
      LSAS-SR >30). The primary outcome was level of social anxiety (LSAS-SR) at the end 
      of treatment. A total of 252 persons were screened, and 38 patients were randomized 
      and started therapy (CBT: 20 patients; ST: 18 patients; age: M = 36 years, SD = 14). 
      Within-group, simple-effect intent-to-treat analyses (ITT) showed significant 
      reduction in LSAS-SR (CBT: d = 1.04; ST: d = 1.67), while ITT mixed-design ANOVA 
      demonstrated the advantage of ST (d = 0.81). Per-protocol analyses supported these 
      results. Remission based on reliable change indices also demonstrated significant 
      difference (LSAS-SR: 15% in CBT; 39% in ST; h: 0.550), supported by blind 
      diagnosticians' ratings of those who completed therapy (SCID; 45% in CBT, 78% in ST, 
      p = .083). No adverse events were reported. CBT and ST both reduced social anxiety, 
      supporting patient improvement with the newly developed ST for SAD; this has yet to 
      be verified in a subsequent confirmatory RCT.

TI  - Examining Positive and Negative Affect as Outcomes and Moderators of 
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Social 
      Anxiety Disorder.

LID - S0005-7894(19)30080-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.beth.2019.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders has been 
      designed to target reductions in negative affect (NA) associated with 
      defense-related processes. However, a subset of anxiety disorders, including social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD), are also characterized by low positive affect (PA) resulting 
      from separate deficits in appetitive-related processes. In contrast to CBT, 
      "third-wave" approaches, such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), align more 
      consistently with motivational processes and, as a result, PA. However, the 
      differential effect of CBT and ACT on PA and NA has yet to be investigated. Using 
      secondary data from a randomized controlled trial, the present study sought to 
      compare CBT's (n = 45) and ACT's (n = 35) effect on PA and NA in SAD. Findings were 
      compared to a wait-list (WL) control condition (n = 31), as well as normative data 
      from a general adult sample. Baseline PA and NA were also examined as moderators and 
      predictors of theory-relevant treatment outcomes. NA decreased significantly in both 
      CBT and ACT from pre to posttreatment. Although ACT outperformed WL in reducing NA, 
      this effect was not observed for CBT. PA increased significantly in both CBT and ACT 
      from pre to posttreatment, with neither ACT nor CBT outperforming WL in increasing 
      PA. Neither PA nor NA were found to moderate theoretically relevant treatment 
      outcomes. Findings suggest that ACT and CBT share common treatment mechanisms, 
      making them more similar than distinct. Further efforts should be focused on 
      optimizing CBT's and ACT's influence on threat and reward learning, and elucidating 
      common processes of change.

TI  - Clinical and cost-effectiveness of one-session treatment (OST) versus multisession 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for specific phobias in children: protocol for a 
      non-inferiority randomised controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Specific phobias (intense, enduring fears of an object or situation 
      that lead to avoidance and severe distress) are highly prevalent among children and 
      young people. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a well-established, effective 
      intervention, but it can be time consuming and costly because it is routinely 
      delivered over multiple sessions during several months. Alternative methods of 
      treating severe and debilitating phobias in children are needed, like one-session 
      treatment (OST), to reduce time and cost, and to prevent therapeutic drift and help 
      children recover quickly. Our study explores whether (1) outcomes with OST are 'no 
      worse' than outcomes with multisession CBT, (2) OST is acceptable to children, their 
      parents and the practitioners who use it and (3) OST offers good value for money to 
      the National Health Service (NHS) and to society. METHOD: A pragmatic, 
      non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial will compare OST with multisession 
      CBT-based therapy on their clinical and cost-effectiveness. The primary clinical 
      outcome is a standardised behavioural task of approaching the feared stimulus at 6 
      months postrandomisation. The outcomes for the within-trial cost-effectiveness 
      analysis are quality-adjusted life years based on EQ-5D-Y, and individual-level 
      costs based of the intervention and use of health and social service care. A nested 
      qualitative evaluation will explore children's, parents' and practitioners' 
      perceptions and experiences of OST. A total of 286 children, 7-16 years old, with 
      DSM-IV diagnoses of specific phobia will be recruited via gatekeepers in the NHS, 
      schools and voluntary youth services, and via public adverts. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The trial received ethical approval from North East and York Research 
      Ethics Committee (Reference: 17/NE/0012). Dissemination plans include publications 
      in peer-reviewed journals, presentations in relevant research conferences, local 
      research symposia and seminars for children and their families, and for 
      professionals and service managers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Assessment and treatment of social phobia.
PG  - 826-34
AB  - Social phobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by heightened fear and avoidance 
      of one or more social or performance situations, including public speaking, meeting 
      new people, eating or writing in front of others, and attending social gatherings. 
      People with social phobia are typically anxious about the possibility that others 
      will evaluate them negatively and/or notice symptoms of their anxiety. Social phobia 
      affects up to 13% of individuals at some time in their lives and is usually 
      associated with at least moderate functional impairment. Research on the nature and 
      treatment of social phobia has increased dramatically over the past decade. As with 
      many of the anxiety disorders, sensitive assessment instruments and effective 
      treatments now exist for people suffering from heightened social anxiety. Typical 
      assessment strategies include clinical interviews, behavioural assessments, 
      monitoring diaries, and self-report questionnaires. Treatments with demonstrated 
      efficacy for social phobia include pharmacotherapy (for example, phenelzine, 
      moclobemide, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medications) and 
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (for example, cognitive restructuring, in vivo 
      exposure, social skills training). Although preliminary comparative studies suggest 
      that both approaches are about equally effective in the short term, each approach 
      has advantages and disadvantages over the other. Trials examining combined 
      psychological and pharmacological treatments are now under way, although no 
      published data on the relative efficacy of combined treatments are currently 
      available.

AB  - Introduction: Classical well-established treatments of social anxiety disorder (SAD) 
      are now complemented by more recent therapeutic strategies. This review aims to 
      summarize available therapies for SAD and discuss recent evidence-based findings on 
      the management of this disorder.Areas covered: Recent guidelines recommend 
      psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and pharmacotherapy, 
      as first-line treatments of patients with SAD, without a clear superiority of one 
      option over the other. CBT includes classical approaches such as in vivo exposure to 
      social situations and cognitive therapy, but new modalities and techniques have been 
      recently developed: third-wave approaches, internet-delivered therapy, virtual 
      reality exposure, and cognitive bias modification. Selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have been also 
      extensively studied and shown to be effective in SAD. Two alternative strategies 
      have been developed to treat SAD with disappointing results: cognitive bias 
      modification, and pharmacological augmentation of psychotherapy using D-cycloserine 
      during exposure sessions.Expert opinion: Personalized treatments for SAD patients 
      are now available. Innovative strategies such as online psychotherapy and virtual 
      reality exposure are useful alternatives to CBT and SSRIs. Future developments and 
      optimization of attention bias modification and of pharmacological augmentation of 
      psychotherapy can be promising.

TI  - Relative effects of CBT and pharmacotherapy in depression versus anxiety: is 
      medication somewhat better for depression, and CBT somewhat better for anxiety?
PG  - 560-7
LID - 10.1002/da.20829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or 
      pharmacotherapy is relatively more advantageous for depressive versus anxiety 
      disorders. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis wherein we searched electronic 
      databases and references to select randomized controlled studies comparing CBT and 
      pharmacotherapy, with or without placebo, in adults with major depressive or anxiety 
      disorders. The primary effect size was calculated from disorder-specific outcome 
      measures as the difference between CBT and pharmacotherapy outcomes (i.e., positive 
      effect size favors CBT; negative effect size favors pharmacotherapy). RESULTS: 
      Twenty-one anxiety (N = 1,266) and twenty-one depression (N = 2,027) studies 
      comparing medication to CBT were included. Including all anxiety disorders, the 
      overall effect size was.25 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.55, P =.07). Effects for panic disorder 
      significantly favored CBT over medications (.50, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.98). 
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder showed similar effects-sizes, though not statistically 
      significant (.49, 95% CI: -0.11, 1.09). Medications showed a nonsignificant 
      advantage for social anxiety disorder (-.22, 95% CI: -0.50, 0.06). The overall 
      effect size for depression studies was.05 (95% CI: -0.09, 0.19), with no advantage 
      for medications or CBT. Pooling anxiety disorder and depression studies, the omnibus 
      comparison of the relative difference between anxiety and depression in 
      effectiveness for CBT versus pharmacotherapy pointed to a nonsignificant advantage 
      for CBT in anxiety versus depression (B =.14, 95% CI: -0.14, 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: On 
      balance, the evidence presented here indicates that there are at most very modest 
      differences in effects of CBT versus pharmacotherapy in the treatment of anxiety 
      versus depressive disorders. There seems to be larger differences between the 
      anxiety disorders in terms of their relative responsiveness to pharmacotherapy 
      versus CBT.

TI  - Exercise in the treatment of clinical anxiety in general practice - a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 559

LID - 559
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are common, yet treatment options in general practice 
      are often limited to medication or CBT. There is a lack of evidence for the 
      effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of anxiety in patients who present to 
      general practice and also about the intensity of exercise required to lead to 
      improvement. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the use of exercise 
      versus waiting list control groups in the treatment of anxiety and also to assess 
      the benefit of high intensity exercise vs low intensity exercise. Long term follow 
      up scores were also analysed. We included patients who met diagnostic criteria for 
      anxiety disorders or had clinically raised anxiety levels on a validated rating 
      scale and performed a subgroup analysis of the outcomes between the two groups. The 
      intervention was any aerobic exercise programme carried out for at least two weeks, 
      or exercise carried out at high intensity for at least two weeks. The comparison 
      groups were either a waiting list control group or low intensity exercise. METHOD: 
      Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Three databases were searched; 
      CENTRAL, Medline and Embase. Outcome assessment was based on validated anxiety 
      rating scales. The quality of the studies was appraised according to the Cochrane 
      Risk of Bias tool. Effect sizes were calculated using the standardised mean 
      difference. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were identified with a total of 675 patients. 
      Nine trials had participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders and six trials had 
      participants with raised anxiety on a validated rating scale. Aerobic exercise was 
      effective in the treatment of raised anxiety compared to waiting list control groups 
      (effect size - 0.41, 95% CI = - 0.70 to - 0.12). High intensity exercise programmes 
      showed greater effects than low intensity programmes. There was no significant 
      difference in outcomes between groups of patients with diagnosed anxiety disorders 
      and patients who had raised anxiety on a rating scale. Conclusions were limited by 
      the small number of studies and wide variation in the delivery of exercise 
      interventions. CONCLUSION: Exercise programmes are a viable treatment option for the 
      treatment of anxiety. High intensity exercise regimens were found to be more 
      effective than low intensity regimens. The results have implications for the use of 
      exercise schemes in General Practice.

TI  - Parental anxiety as a predictor of medication and CBT response for anxious youth.
PG  - 84-93
LID - 10.1007/s10578-014-0454-6 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to evaluate how parental anxiety predicted change 
      in pediatric anxiety symptoms across four different interventions: 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication (sertraline; SRT), their combination 
      (COMB), and pill placebo. Participants were 488 youths (ages 7-17) with separation 
      anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia and their 
      primary caregivers. Latent growth curve modeling assessed how pre-treatment parental 
      trait anxiety symptoms predicted trajectories of youth anxiety symptom change across 
      12 weeks of treatment at four time points. Interactions between parental anxiety and 
      treatment condition were tested. Parental anxiety was not associated with youth's 
      pre-treatment anxiety symptom severity. Controlling for parental trait anxiety, 
      youth depressive symptoms, and youth age, youths who received COMB benefitted most. 
      Counter to expectations, parental anxiety influenced youth anxiety symptom 
      trajectory only within the SRT condition, whereas parental anxiety was not 
      significantly associated with youth anxiety trajectories in the other treatment 
      conditions. Specifically, within the SRT condition, higher levels of parental 
      anxiety predicted a faster and greater reduction in youth anxiety over the acute 
      treatment period compared to youths in the SRT condition whose parents had lower 
      anxiety levels. While all active treatments produced favorable outcomes, results 
      provide insight regarding the treatment-specific influence of parental anxiety on 
      the time course of symptom change.

TI  - HPA AXIS RELATED GENES AND RESPONSE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES: GENETICS AND 
      EPIGENETICS.
PG  - 861-70
LID - 10.1002/da.22430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning has been 
      implicated in the development of stress-related psychiatric diagnoses and response 
      to adverse life experiences. This study aimed to investigate the association between 
      genetic and epigenetics in HPA axis and response to cognitive behavior therapy 
      (CBT). METHODS: Children with anxiety disorders were recruited into the Genes for 
      Treatment project (GxT, N = 1,152). Polymorphisms of FKBP5 and GR were analyzed for 
      association with response to CBT. Percentage DNA methylation at the FKBP5 and GR 
      promoter regions was measured before and after CBT in a subset (n = 98). Linear 
      mixed effect models were used to investigate the relationship between genotype, DNA 
      methylation, and change in primary anxiety disorder severity (treatment response). 
      RESULTS: Treatment response was not associated with FKBP5 and GR polymorphisms, or 
      pretreatment percentage DNA methylation. However, change in FKBP5 DNA methylation 
      was nominally significantly associated with treatment response. Participants who 
      demonstrated the greatest reduction in severity decreased in percentage DNA 
      methylation during treatment, whereas those with little/no reduction in severity 
      increased in percentage DNA methylation. This effect was driven by those with one or 
      more FKBP5 risk alleles, with no association seen in those with no FKBP5 risk 
      alleles. No significant association was found between GR methylation and response. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Allele-specific change in FKBP5 methylation was associated with 
      treatment response. This is the largest study to date investigating the role of HPA 
      axis related genes in response to a psychological therapy. Furthermore, this is the 
      first study to demonstrate that DNA methylation changes may be associated with 
      response to psychological therapies in a genotype-dependent manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last few decades, there has been a growing interest in anxiety 
      disorders (AnxD) in the perinatal period. Although AnxD are diagnosed in 4-39% of 
      pregnant women and in up to 16% of women after delivery, evidence on their clinical 
      management is limited. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on pharmacological 
      and non-pharmacological treatment of AnxD in the perinatal period. Relevant papers 
      published from January 1st 2015 were identified searching the electronic databases 
      MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: 18 articles met 
      inclusion criteria. Selected studies supported the use of cognitive-behavioural 
      therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD) and 
      specific phobia both in pregnancy and postpartum. Selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs) led to significant OCD and PD improvement both in pregnancy and 
      postpartum with no side effects for the babies. In the largest clinical sample to 
      date, 65% of postpartum patients who entered the open-label trial of fluvoxamine (up 
      to 300mg/day) experienced a 30% or greater decrease in the total score of the 
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). During pregnancy, SSRIs and 
      tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) led to remission of panic symptoms and healthy 
      outcomes for the babies. LIMITATIONS: Study design, mostly case reports, and 
      enrolment of subjects mainly from outpatient specialty units might have limited 
      community-wide generalisability. CONCLUSIONS: Keeping in mind the scantiness and 
      heterogeneity of the available literature, the best interpretation of the available 
      evidence appears to be that CBT should be the first treatment offered to pregnant 
      and breastfeeding women with AnxD. However SSRIs can represent a first line 
      treatment strategy, and not exclusively in cases where AnxD is refractory to CBT.

LID - CD004690
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous Cochrane review (James 2005) showed that cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; 
      however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus non-CBT 
      active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and the 
      combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long-term effects of 
      CBT.  OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood 
      and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait-list controls; (b) 
      active non-CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, bibliotherapy and treatment 
      as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the combination of medication and CBT versus 
      placebo; and (2) the long-term effects of CBT. SEARCH METHODS: Searches for this 
      review included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the 
      Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant 
      randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases－The Cochrane Library 
      (1970 to July 2012), EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and 
      PsycINFO (1970 to July 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of CBT versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were 
      reviewed. All participants must have met the criteria of the Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for 
      an anxiety diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder and elective mutism. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers 
      independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the 
      odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects model, 
      with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was used. 
      Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child's anxiety symptoms 
      were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one 
      studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies 
      involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in 
      university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of 
      remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, 
      intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR 
      of 7.85 (95% CI 5.31 to 11.60, Z = 10.26, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate 
      heterogeneity (P = 0.04, I² = 33%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 6.0 (95% CI 
      7.5 to 4.6). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and 
      family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than 
      non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing 
      anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow-up 
      studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis 
      are not statistically significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural 
      therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; 
      however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or 
      TAU or medication at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive.

TI  - Virtual reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy for patients with generalized 
      social anxiety disorder: a pilot study.
PG  - 745-750
LID - 10.1017/S1352465819000225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD) avoid various 
      social situations and can be reluctant to engage in in vivo exposure therapy. Highly 
      personalized practising can be required before patients are ready to perform in vivo 
      exposure. Virtual reality-based therapy could be beneficial for this group. AIMS: To 
      assess the feasibility and potential effect of virtual reality-based cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (VR-CBT) for patients with severe generalized SAD. METHODS: 
      Fifteen patients with generalized SAD attended up to 16 VR-CBT sessions. 
      Questionnaires on clinical and functional outcomes, and diary assessments on social 
      activity, social anxiety and paranoia were completed at baseline, post-treatment and 
      at 6-months follow-up. RESULTS: Two patients dropped out of treatment. Improvements 
      in social anxiety and quality of life were found at post-treatment. At follow-up, 
      depressive symptoms had decreased, and the effect on social anxiety was maintained. 
      With respect to diary assessments, social anxiety in company and paranoia were 
      significantly reduced by post-treatment. These improvements were maintained at 
      follow-up. No increase was observed in social activity. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      uncontrolled pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and treatment potential of 
      VR-CBT in a difficult-to-treat group of patients with generalized SAD. Results 
      suggest that VR-CBT may be effective in reducing anxiety as well as depression, and 
      can increase quality of life.

AB  - With a lifetime prevalence of 13% social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is a 
      common and serious condition that should not be played down because of the burden 
      associated with the disorder, an increased suicide rate and the frequent comorbidity 
      with substance abuse disorders. Social phobia is characterized by the excessive and 
      unrealistic fear of being scrutinized or criticized by others. The disorder often 
      begins in adolescence.Symptoms of social phobia can be effectively treated with 
      evidence-based treatment, including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and 
      psychopharmacological medications. In the present paper, treatment recommendations 
      are given, which are based on a systematic review of all available randomized trials 
      for the treatment of social phobia. Among psychological therapies, variants of CBT 
      have been proven to be effective in controlled studies. Selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs) and the selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor 
      (SNRI) venlafaxine are among the drugs of first choice.

PG  - 144-156

AB  - Among children and adolescents, anxiety disorders are common psychiatric disorders 
      that confer risk of comorbid psychiatric disorders and social and academic 
      impairment. This review focuses on the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders 
      among children and adolescents, with attention to separation anxiety disorder, 
      social phobia disorder (social anxiety disorder), panic disorder, and generalized 
      anxiety disorder. Comprehensive assessment of child and adolescent anxiety disorders 
      benefits from a multimethod approach to evaluation and diagnosis, including 
      semistructured interviews; child and informant questionnaires; collateral 
      information from parents, teachers, pediatricians, and school psychologists; and 
      behavioral observations. Because anxiety symptoms can include avoidance behaviors, 
      somatic complaints, social difficulties, and sleep disturbances, consideration of a 
      differential diagnosis is important. Among the available psychosocial interventions, 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure-based therapies have emerged as the 
      most well-established treatment approaches for addressing anxiety disorders among 
      children and adolescents. Pharmacologically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIs) have been established to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of 
      pediatric anxiety and are considered the medications of choice for this population. 
      Research indicates that CBT plus SSRI medication is the most effective treatment of 
      anxiety for youths ages seven to 17, compared with either CBT or medication alone. 
      Medication monotherapy and CBT monotherapy have also been demonstrated to be 
      effective treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
      many children and adolescents with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), therapeutic 
      response is variable. Fear conditioning and extinction are central constructs 
      underlying exposure-based CBT. Fear extinction learning assessed prior to CBT may be 
      a useful predictor of CBT response for guiding treatment decisions. METHODS: 
      Sixty-four youth who participated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of CBT 
      with and without d-cycloserine (DCS) completed a fear conditioning task. Skin 
      conductance response (SCR) scores were used to measure fear acquisition and 
      extinction to determine whether extinction learning could predict CBT response. 
      RESULTS: CBT responders and non-responders appeared to acquire conditioned fear SCRs 
      in a similar manner. However, differences between treatment responders and 
      non-responders emerged during the extinction phase. A responder (responder, 
      non-responder) by conditioned stimulus type (CS+, CS-) interaction showed that CBT 
      responders differentiated the stimulus paired with (CS+) and without (CS-) the 
      unconditioned stimulus correctly during early and late extinction, whereas the CBT 
      non-responders did not (p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: While the small sample size makes 
      conclusions tentative, this study supports an emerging literature that differential 
      fear extinction may be an important factor underlying clinical correlates of 
      pediatric OCD, including CBT response.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This two-year follow-up study evaluated the long-term 
      outcomes of two early interventions that aimed at reducing social and test anxiety 
      in young adolescents at risk for developing social anxiety disorder. METHODS: In 
      this RCT, moderately socially anxious adolescents (N=240, mean age 13.6 years) were 
      randomly assigned to a 10-week internet-based multifaceted cognitive bias 
      modification training (CBM), a 10-week school-based cognitive behavioral group 
      training (CBT), or a no-intervention control condition. Using multiple imputation, 
      this study examined the changes in primary and secondary outcome measures from 
      pretest to follow-up in a repeated measures design. RESULTS: Primary outcome: 
      Self-reported social and test anxiety generally decreased from pre-test to two-year 
      follow-up, regardless of treatment condition. The percentage of adolescents who 
      developed a social anxiety disorder was very low (6%) and similar across conditions. 
      Secondary outcome: There were beneficial changes in self-esteem, self-reported 
      prosocial behaviors, and fear of negative evaluation, but none of these were related 
      to treatment condition. Automatic social-threat associations did not significantly 
      change. The CBM intervention was effective in changing interpretative bias as 
      indexed by the Recognition Task but this long-term effect did not transfer to the 
      Adolescent Interpretation and Belief Questionnaire. LIMITATIONS: There was a 
      substantial (50%) though seemingly non-selective attrition at follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This RCT does not support the longer-term efficacy of school-based CBT 
      or CBM as an early intervention for social and test anxiety. Rather, it emphasizes 
      the positive 'natural' course of highly socially anxious adolescents over two years.

TI  - Effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy on brain responses to subliminal and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurocircuitry models of anxiety disorders suggest dysregulated 
      mechanisms encompassing both automatic and elaborate threat processing. However, the 
      extent to which these processes might be differentially modified by psychotherapy 
      and the neural basis of such changes are unknown. We examined the effects of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with anxiety disorder on brain 
      responses to subliminal and supraliminal threat. METHODS: 3-Tesla functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess neural responses to disorder-related 
      stimuli, presented during two backward-masking conditions employed to manipulate 
      stimulus awareness. In 28 spider-phobic patients randomly assigned to a therapy 
      group or a waiting-list control group scanning was performed before and after 
      completing CBT or a waiting period. Scanning was performed one time in 16 healthy 
      control subjects. Self-report and behavioral measures were used to relate 
      CBT-mediated brain activation changes with symptom improvement. RESULTS: Untreated 
      patients demonstrated abnormal hyperactivation in the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, 
      insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Successful CBT 
      was reflected in an overall downregulation in these fear circuitry structures, 
      especially in the right amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, with reductions in 
      amygdala responsiveness associated with self-reported symptom improvement. However, 
      subliminal threat induced a pattern of right-lateralized hyperactivation in the 
      amygdala and fusiform gyrus that was subject to intersession habituation across 
      groups without showing significant sensitivity to CBT. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      challenge prevailing models that emphasize a role for amygdala automaticity in the 
      maintenance of anxiety. Our results suggest CBT-related changes in neural activation 
      associated with fear responses to consciously perceived threat.

TI  - Transfer of manualized CBT for social phobia into clinical practice (SOPHO-PRAX): a 
      study protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-13-70 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is generally known to be efficacious 
      in the treatment of social phobia when applied in RCTs, namely when the treatment 
      manual is based on the Clark-Wells approach. However, little is known about the 
      efficacy of manualized treatments in routine clinical practice (Phase IV of 
      psychotherapy research). The present study (SOPHO-PRAX) is a continuation of a large 
      multicenter randomized clinical trial (SOPHO-NET) and analyzes the extent to which 
      additional training practitioners in manualized procedures enhances treatment 
      effect. METHODS/DESIGN: Thirty-six private practitioners will be included in three 
      treatment centers and randomly designated to either training in manualized CBT or no 
      specific training. The treatment effects of the therapies conducted by both groups 
      of therapists will be compared. A total of 162 patients (n=116 completers; n=58 per 
      condition) will be enrolled. Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) will serve as 
      primary outcome measure. Remission from social phobia is defined as LSAS total ≤ 30 
      points. Data will be collected at treatment begin, after 8, 15, and 25 sessions (50 
      min each), at treatment completion, as well at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. 
      DISCUSSION: The present CBT trial combines elements of randomized controlled trials 
      and naturalistic studies in an innovative way. It will directly inform about the 
      incremental effects of procedures established in a controlled trial into clinical 
      practice. Study results are relevant to healthcare decisions and policy. They may 
      serve to improve quality of treatment, and shorten the time frame between the 
      development and widespread dissemination of effective methods, thereby reducing 
      health cost expenditure.The results of this study will not only inform about the 
      degree to which the new methods lead to an improvement of treatment course and 
      outcome, but also about whether the effects of routine psychotherapeutic treatment 
      are comparable to those of the controlled, strictly manualized treatments of the 
      SOPHO-NET study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01388231. 
      This study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research 
      (SOPHO-NET: BMBF 01GV0607; SOPHO-PRAX: BMBF 01GV1001).

LID - 10.1111/nyas.12318 [doi]
AB  - This article provides a brief review of the current available data concerning 
      present treatment and potential new treatment advances for pediatric anxiety 
      disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social 
      phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. 
      Disorder-specific treatment methods and innovations, particularly computer-assisted 
      methods of delivery for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) will be reviewed. 
      Additionally, the paper will discuss novel psychopharmacological compounds (e.g., 
      D-cycloserine, riluzole, memantine, and anticonvulsant medications). Available 
      evidence for the efficacy of novel medication strategies in adult studies and 
      implications for their use in pediatrics will be discussed.

AB  - Lars-Göran Öst is one of the most eminent clinical researchers in the field of 
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and a founder of CBT in Sweden. He has recently 
      retired from his position as professor in clinical psychology at Stockholm 
      University, Sweden. In this paper, we sketch a brief description of the body of work 
      by Öst. Examples of his innovative and pioneering new treatment methods include the 
      one-session treatment for specific phobias, as well as applied relaxation for a 
      range of anxiety disorders and health conditions. While Öst remains active in the 
      field, he has contributed significantly to the development and dissemination of CBT 
      in Sweden as well as in the world.

TI  - Augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies (CBT) with d-cycloserine for 
      anxiety and related disorders.
PG  - CD007803
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007803.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients who suffer with anxiety and related 
      disorders (that is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder 
      (SAnD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD), specific phobia (SPh) and 
      obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) fail to respond optimally to first-line 
      treatment with medication or cognitive and behavioural therapies. The addition of 
      d-cycloserine (DCS) to cognitive and behavioural therapies may improve treatment 
      response by impacting the glutamatergic system. This systematic review aimed to 
      investigate the effects of adding DCS to cognitive and behavioural therapies by 
      synthesising data from relevant randomised controlled trials and following the 
      guidelines recommended by Cochrane. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of DCS 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared to placebo augmentation 
      of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety and related 
      disorders. Additionally, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of DCS across 
      different anxiety and related disorders. SEARCH METHODS: This review fully 
      incorporates studies identified from a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety 
      and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 12 March 2015. This register 
      includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library 
      (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date), 
      the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov . 
      Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of RCTs were also checked. 
      No restrictions were placed on language, setting, date or publication status. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural 
      therapies versus placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for 
      anxiety and related disorders were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two 
      authors (RO and TA) independently assessed RCTs for eligibility and inclusion, 
      extracted outcomes and risk of bias data and entered these into a customised 
      extraction form. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. In addition, 
      data entry and analysis were performed by two review authors (KSW and HB). MAIN 
      RESULTS: Twenty-one published RCTs, with 788 participants in outpatient settings, 
      were included in the review. Sixteen studies had an age range of 18 to 75 years, 
      while four investigated paediatric populations aged 8 to 17 years and one included 
      children, adolescents and adults. The 21 RCTs investigated OCD (number of RCTs (N) = 
      6), PTSD (N = 5), SAnD (N = 5), SPh (N = 3) and PD (N = 2). Most information from 
      the studies was rated as having either low risk or unclear risk of bias.There was no 
      evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural 
      therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for the 
      treatment of anxiety and related disorders in adults at the endpoint (treatment 
      responders, N = 9, risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.34; 
      number of participants (n) = 449; low quality evidence) and between 1 and 12 months 
      follow-up (N = 7, RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31; n = 383). DCS augmentation of 
      cognitive and behavioural therapies was not superior to placebo augmentation of 
      cognitive and behavioural therapies for children and adolescents, both at the 
      endpoint (N = 4, RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; n = 121; low quality evidence) and 
      between 3 and 12 months follow-up (N = 3, RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.09; n = 
      91).There was no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability for DCS 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared with placebo 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in adults (N = 16, RR 0.88; 95% 
      CI 0.61 to 1.25; n = 740), nor in children and adolescents (N = 4, RR 0.90; 95% CI 
      0.17 to 4.69; n = 131). These conclusions were based on moderate quality evidence 
      for adults, and very low quality evidence for children and adolescents. Although the 
      observed difference was small, it is noteworthy that there was a high efficacy of 
      exposure-based therapies alone in the included trials. Due to the limited number of 
      studies, subgroup analysis of moderating factors for clinical and methodological 
      effect could not take place. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review found no evidence of 
      a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and 
      placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for treating anxiety and 
      related disorders in children, adolescents and adults. These findings are based on 
      low quality evidence from heterogenous studies with small sample sizes and 
      incomplete data for clinical response, which precludes us from drawing conclusions 
      on the use of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies at this stage. 
      Given there is some promising preliminary data from individual studies, further 
      research is necessary to assess DCS compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive 
      and behavioural therapies, and determine mechanisms of action as well as magnitude 
      of effect in anxiety and related disorders.

TI  - Baseline Patient Characteristics Predicting Outcome and Attrition in Cognitive 
      Therapy for Social Phobia: Results from a Large Multicentre Trial.
PG  - 35-46
LID - 10.1002/cpp.1936 [doi]
AB  - We examined the role of baseline patient characteristics as predictors of outcome 
      (end-state functioning, response and remission) and attrition for cognitive therapy 
      (CT) in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Beyond socio-demographic and clinical 
      variables such as symptom severity and comorbidity status, previously neglected 
      patient characteristics (e.g., personality, self-esteem, shame, interpersonal 
      problems and attachment style) were analysed. METHOD: Data came from the CT arm of a 
      multicentre RCT with n = 244 patients having DSM-IV SAD. CT was conducted according 
      to the manual by Clark and Wells. Severity of SAD was assessed at baseline and end 
      of treatment with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Multiple linear 
      regression analyses and logistic regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Up to 
      37% of the post-treatment variance (LSAS) could be explained by all pre-treatment 
      variables combined. Symptom severity (baseline LSAS) was consistently negatively 
      associated with end-state functioning and remission, but not with response. Number 
      of comorbid diagnoses was negatively associated with end-state functioning and 
      response, but not with remission. Self-esteem was positively associated with higher 
      end-state functioning and more shame with better response. Attrition could not be 
      significantly predicted. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the initial 
      probability for treatment success mainly depends on severity of disorder and 
      comorbid conditions while other psychological variables are of minor importance, at 
      least on a nomothetic level. This stands in contrast with efforts to arrive at an 
      empirical-based foundation for differential indication and argues to search for more 
      potent moderators of therapeutic change rather on the process level. KEY 
      PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Personality, self-esteem, shame, attachment style and 
      interpersonal problems do not or only marginally moderate the effects of 
      interventions in CT of social phobia. Symptom severity and comorbid diagnoses might 
      affect treatment outcome negatively. Beyond these two factors, most patients share a 
      similar likelihood of treatment success when treated according to the manual by 
      Clark and Wells. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Using Virtual Reality Environments to Augment Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Fears 
      and Phobias in Autistic Adults.
PG  - 134-145
LID - 10.1089/aut.2018.0019 [doi]
AB  - Fears and phobias are common in people on the autism spectrum and can impact on 
      their ability to undertake usual daily activities. Graded exposure to the 
      anxiety-provoking stimulus is a recognized method of treatment for fears/phobias in 
      the nonautistic population but may pose specific difficulties for autistic people. 
      For example, real-life exposure can be too anxiety-provoking to allow treatment to 
      take place, and imaginal exposure can be problematic. To address this, we developed 
      an intervention that combines cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with immersive 
      virtual reality (VR) exposure to reduce anxiety. Following successful trials of this 
      intervention with young people on the autism spectrum, we report a pilot study using 
      the same intervention with autistic adults. Eight adults (aged 18-57 years) received 
      one psychoeducation session and then four 20-minute sessions of graded exposure with 
      a therapist in an immersive VR room (known as the Blue Room). Each participant 
      completed all sessions showing that the intervention is feasible and acceptable. 
      Outcomes were monitored at 6 weeks and 6 months postintervention. Five of the eight 
      participants were classified as intervention responders and at 6 months after the 
      end of intervention were experiencing real-life functional improvements. These 
      preliminary findings show that VR-graded exposure alongside CBT may be an effective 
      treatment for autistic people with phobias. LAY SUMMARY: Why was this study 
      done?Anxiety is common in autistic adults. For some people, fears and phobias 
      regarding everyday objects and situations occur frequently affecting everyday life. 
      The main method to treat fears and phobias for people without autism is gradual 
      exposure to the situation that causes anxiety. However, this method may be 
      challenging for people on the autism spectrum. We wanted to test a new method of 
      treatment that uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered with gradual 
      exposure in a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) environment.What was the purpose 
      of this study?We have already delivered this treatment successfully with autistic 
      children. We wanted to test if this treatment would work for autistic adults. 
      Changing traditional psychological treatments, such as CBT, to make it more suitable 
      for autistic people is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care 
      Excellence.What did the researchers do?We recruited eight autistic adults (aged 
      18-57 years) with a fear/phobia and their supporter (parent/friend/support worker). 
      Each adult had one session with a therapist to learn anxiety management techniques. 
      They then had four 20-minute sessions of graded exposure with a therapist in an 
      immersive VR room (known as the Blue Room). Each participant had a 
      computer-generated scene designed for their specific anxiety-provoking situation. 
      After four sessions, the participant tried real-life exposure with their supporter. 
      We measured progress at 6 weeks and 6 months after the last VR session.What were the 
      results of this study?Each participant completed all four sessions. This shows that 
      the intervention was possible to deliver and acceptable to autistic people and 
      therapists. Participants completed assessments at 6 weeks and 6 months after the VR 
      sessions. Five of the eight participants were "responders" to the intervention. This 
      means that 6 months after the last VR session, they still had real-life day-to-day 
      improvements in relation to their phobia.What do these findings add to what was 
      already known?We had not delivered this intervention to autistic adults previously. 
      The findings show that this VR intervention has the potential to be an effective 
      treatment for anxiety in autistic adults.What are the potential weaknesses in the 
      study?This is a small study and future work will be a larger trial of this 
      treatment-comparing results from people who get the intervention with people who do 
      not. We would also want to have an outcome assessor who did not know whether people 
      had received the intervention or not.How will these findings help autistic adults 
      now or in the future?This new intervention has the potential to help autistic adults 
      manage their anxiety in stressful situations and therefore may improve their quality 
      of life.

TI  - Moclobemide and cognitive behavioral therapy in the treatment of social phobia. A 
      six-month controlled study and 24 months follow up.
PG  - 473-81
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the 6-months treatment efficacy and 24-month 
      follow up of three different therapeutic programs (A. moclobemide and supportive 
      guidance, B. group cognitive-behavioral therapy and pill placebo, and C. combination 
      of moclobemide and group cognitive-behavioral therapy) in patients with a 
      generalized form of social phobia. Eighty one patients (38 males and 43 females) 
      were randomly assigned to three different therapeutic programs. Patients were 
      regularly assessed on a monthly basis by an independent rater on the LSAS (Liebowitz 
      Social Anxiety scale), CGI (Clinical Global Impression) for severity and change and 
      BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory). Altogether, sixty-six patients completed the six month 
      treatment period and 15 patients dropped out. All therapeutic groups showed 
      significant improvement. A combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy yielded the most 
      rapid effect. Moclobemide was superior for the reduction of the subjective general 
      anxiety (BAI) during the first 3 months of treatment, but its influence on avoidant 
      behavior (LSAS avoidance subscale) was less pronounced. Conversely, CBT was the best 
      choice for reduction of avoidant behavior while a reduction of subjective general 
      anxiety appeared later than in moclobemide. After 6 months of treatment there were 
      best results reached in groups treated with CBT and there was no advantage of the 
      combined treatment. The relapse rate during the 24-month follow up was significantly 
      lower in the group treated with CBT in comparison with the group A. formerly treated 
      with moclobemide alone.

TI  - Group schema therapy versus group cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety 
      disorder with comorbid avoidant personality disorder: study protocol for a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 487
LID - 487
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) with comorbid avoidant personality 
      disorder (APD) has a high prevalence and is associated with serious psychosocial 
      problems and high societal costs. When patients suffer from both SAD and APD, the 
      Dutch multidisciplinary guidelines for personality disorders advise offering 
      prolonged cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Recently there is increasing evidence 
      for the effectiveness of schema therapy (ST) for personality disorders such as 
      borderline personality disorder and cluster C personality disorders. Since ST 
      addresses underlying personality characteristics and maladaptive coping strategies 
      developed in childhood, this treatment might be particularly effective for patients 
      with SAD and comorbid APD. To our knowledge, there are no studies comparing CBT with 
      ST in this particular group of patients. This superiority trial aims at comparing 
      the effectiveness of these treatments. As an additional goal, predictors and 
      underlying mechanisms of change will be explored. METHODS/DESIGN: The design of the 
      study is a multicentre two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the 
      treatment effect of group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) will be compared to 
      that of group schema therapy (GST) in a semi-open group format. A total of 128 
      patients aged 18-65 years old will be enrolled. Patients will receive 30 sessions of 
      GCBT or GST during a period of approximately 9 months. Primary outcome measures are 
      the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Self-Report (LSAS-SR) for social anxiety disorder 
      and the newly developed Avoidant Personality Disorder Severity Index (AVPDSI) for 
      avoidant personality disorder. Secondary outcome measures are the MINI section SAD, 
      the SCID-II section APD, the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI-2), the Inventory of 
      Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR), the World Health Organization 
      Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale 
      (DERS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and the Acceptance and Action 
      Questionnaire (AAQ-II). Data will be collected at the start, halfway and at the end 
      of the treatment, followed by measurements at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment. 
      DISCUSSION: The trial will increase our knowledge on the effectiveness and 
      applicability of both treatment modalities for patients suffering from both 
      diagnoses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register: NTR3921 . Registered on 25

TI  - The impact of treatment delivery format on response to cognitive behaviour therapy 
      for preadolescent children with anxiety disorders.
PG  - 763-772
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12872 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several delivery formats of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for child 
      anxiety have been proposed, however, there is little consensus on the optimal 
      delivery format. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the impact of the 
      child's primary anxiety diagnosis on changes in clinical severity (of the primary 
      problem) during individual CBT, group CBT and guided parent-led CBT. The secondary 
      goal was to investigate the impact of the child's primary anxiety diagnosis on rates 
      of remission for the three treatment formats. METHODS: A sample of 1,253 children 
      (5-12 years; Mage = 9.3, SD = 1.7) was pooled from CBT trials carried out at 10 
      sites. Children had a primary diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), 
      social anxiety disorder (SoAD), specific phobia (SP) or separation anxiety disorder 
      (SAD). Children and parents completed a semistructured clinical interview to assess 
      the presence and severity of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders at preintervention, 
      postintervention and follow-up. Linear mixture modelling was used to evaluate the 
      primary research question and logistic modelling was used to investigate the 
      secondary research question. RESULTS: In children with primary GAD, SAD or SoAD, 
      there were no significant differences between delivery formats. However, children 
      with primary SP showed significantly larger reductions in clinical severity 
      following individual CBT compared to group CBT and guided parent-led CBT. The 
      results were mirrored in the analysis of remission responses with the exception that 
      individual CBT was no longer superior to group CBT for children with a primary SP. 
      The difference between individual and group was not significant when follow-up data 
      were examined separately. CONCLUSIONS: Data show there may be greater clinical 
      benefit by allocating children with a primary SP to individual CBT, although future 
      research on cost-effectiveness is needed to determine whether the additional 
      clinical benefits justify the additional resources required.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study examines the effects of a single session of 
      Cognitive Bias Modification to induce positive Interpretative bias (CBM-I) using 
      standard or explicit instructions and an analogue of computer-administered CBT 
      (c-CBT) program on modifying cognitive biases and social anxiety. METHODS: A sample 
      of 76 volunteers with social anxiety attended a research site. At both pre- and 
      post-test, participants completed two computer-administered tests of interpretative 
      and attentional biases and a self-report measure of social anxiety. Participants in 
      the training conditions completed a single session of either standard or explicit 
      CBM-I positive training and a c-CBT program. Participants in the Control (no 
      training) condition completed a CBM-I neutral task matched the active CBM-I 
      intervention in format and duration but did not encourage positive disambiguation of 
      socially ambiguous or threatening scenarios. RESULTS: Participants in both CBM-I 
      programs (either standard or explicit instructions) and the c-CBT condition 
      exhibited more positive interpretations of ambiguous social scenarios at post-test 
      and one-week follow-up as compared to the Control condition. Moreover, the results 
      showed that CBM-I and c-CBT, to some extent, changed negative attention biases in a 
      positive direction. Furthermore, the results showed that both CBM-I training 
      conditions and c-CBT reduced social anxiety symptoms at one-week follow-up. 
      LIMITATIONS: This study used a single session of CBM-I training, however 
      multi-sessions intervention might result in more endurable positive CBM-I changes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A computerised single session of CBM-I and an analogue of c-CBT program 
      reduced negative interpretative biases and social anxiety.

LID - 10.1007/s10880-008-9143-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the initial feasibility and potential efficacy of a 
      cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with anxiety disorders and non-medical 
      somatic symptoms. BACKGROUND: Based on a strong relationship between somatic 
      complaints and anxiety disorders, screening youngsters seeking medical care due to 
      physical symptoms with no organic basis may enhance the recognition of anxiety 
      disorders and facilitate access to appropriate services. METHOD: Seven boys and 
      girls, ages 8 through 15, with medically unexplained gastrointestinal complaints and 
      anxiety disorders received a 12-session cognitive-behavioral intervention targeting 
      anxiety and physical symptoms. Assessments were conducted at baseline and following 
      treatment. RESULTS: All participants were classified as treatment responders. Three 
      of the seven participants no longer met diagnostic criteria for their principal 
      anxiety disorder. Children's physical discomfort decreased from a moderate to 
      minimal level based on self- and parent-reports. CONCLUSIONS: Our modified 
      cognitive-behavioral approach has promise for reducing anxiety and somatic symptoms 
      in children seeking medical care.

TI  - Psychological treatments for social phobia.
PG  - 308-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the empirical status of psychological treatments for social 
      phobia (SP), commenting both on cognitive-behavioural interventions and on more 
      recent iterations of those approaches. We also review the effective components of 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). METHOD: We qualitatively reviewed the empirical 
      literature on the psychological treatment of SP. We include empirical studies, 
      metaanalyses, and recent conference presentations in this review. RESULTS: Cognitive 
      and behavioural interventions for SP appear to be more effective than wait-list 
      controls and supportive therapy. Comparisons of CBT and pharmacologic treatment have 
      produced inconsistent results. Several new treatments for SP demonstrate promising 
      results. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that various psychosocial treatments for SP 
      are better than wait-list controls and credible placebo interventions. Ongoing 
      projects investigate the relative efficacy of combining medication and psychosocial 
      treatments over monotherapies; this line of research is important to continue. 
      Further research should also focus on which components of CBT are most effective.

AB  - This study examined (a) demographic and clinical characteristics associated with 
      sleep-related problems (SRPs) among youth with anxiety disorders, and (b) the impact 
      of anxiety treatment: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping Cat), medication 
      (sertraline), their combination, and pill placebo on SRPs. Youth (N = 488, ages 
      7-17, 50% female, 79% White) with a principal diagnosis of generalized anxiety 
      disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or social phobia participated. SRPs were 
      reported by parents and youth. Findings differed by informant and by type of SRP, 
      with evidence that SRPs are associated with age, anxiety severity, externalizing 
      problems, functional impairment, and family burden at pretreatment. Anxiety 
      treatment reduced SRPs; effect sizes were small to medium. Reductions in 
      parent-reported separation-related sleep difficulties were significantly greater in 
      active treatment than in the placebo condition, with the greatest reductions 
      reported by parents of youth whose active treatment was multimodal or included 
      sertraline. Youth whose anxiety treatment involved CBT reported significantly 
      greater decreases in dysregulated sleep (e.g., sleeplessness). Both CBT for anxiety 
      and sertraline appear to be somewhat effective in reducing SRPs, and multimodal 
      treatment may be preferable depending on the symptom presentation. To inform 
      practice, future research should examine a broad range of SRPs, incorporate 
      objective measures of sleep, and evaluate the impact of behavioral strategies that 
      directly target SRPs in youth with anxiety disorders.

AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents that form of psychotherapy which has 
      most research data to build on in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders for 
      adults. In this review we will introduce CBT and present the results of pertinent 
      outcome research. Efficacy at the end of treatment is discussed, as well as long 
      term effectiveness and the efficacy of combined treatment with medication and CBT. 
      In addition, we discuss the pros and cons of group CBT compared to CBT in individual 
      format, and comorbidity of mental disorders. According to this review CBT is 
      efficacious for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic 
      disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social 
      phobia and specific phobia. Efficacy of CBT is equal to or better than efficacy of 
      drugs in the treatment of the above disorders, but there is less access to CBT. 
      Longterm effectiveness of CBT appears to be good, but research on combined treatment 
      is yet in its infancy and conclusions are premature on its place in treatment. Key 
      words: Cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotropic treatment, efficacy, long-term 
      effects, combined treatment, mental disorders, adults.

TI  - Pharmacologic Treatment of Pediatric Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - 151-160
AB  - The last decade has seen considerable advances in the treatment of anxiety disorders 
      in children and adolescents and a considerable expansion of the evidence base for 
      psychopharmacologic in this population. The extant data suggest that, for fear-based 
      anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia/social anxiety 
      disorder, and separation anxiety disorder), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIs) and selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) are well 
      tolerated and offer considerable benefit. However, the salutary effects of SSRIs and 
      SSNRIs in pediatric anxiety disorders are consistently amplified by the addition of 
      psychotherapy, particularly in individuals with social anxiety disorder. 
      Additionally, several key demographic and clinical factors, including male sex, 
      non-minority status, and better family functioning and younger age predict greater 
      symptomatic improvement in youth with fear-based anxiety disorders. Thus, current 
      data suggest that in addition to several forms of psychotherapy, including 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), SSRIs and SSNRIs are efficacious in the 
      treatment of these conditions in youth and that CBT + an SSRI may be associated with 
      greater improvement than would be expected with either treatment as monotherapy. 
      Finally, given that some children and adolescents may exhibit partial response to 
      current pharmacotherapies, benzodiazepines, anti-histamines and other agents may 
      have adjunctive roles, despite a lack of data in terms of large, randomized 
      controlled trials.

PG  - 99-110
LID - 10.1007/s11920-010-0173-z [doi]
AB  - This article reviews the current screening and assessment tools for anxiety 
      disorders in children and adolescents, as well as evidence-based treatment 
      interventions for these disorders. The following anxiety disorders are discussed: 
      separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic 
      disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and selective mutism. There are 
      several well-studied screening and assessment tools to identify childhood anxiety 
      disorders early and differentiate the various anxiety disorders. Evaluations of 
      baseline somatic symptoms, severity, and impairment ratings of the anxiety 
      disorders, and collecting ratings from several sources is clinically helpful in 
      assessment and treatment follow-up. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been 
      extensively studied and has shown good efficacy in treatment of childhood anxiety 
      disorders. A combination of CBT and medication may be required for moderate to 
      severely impairing anxiety disorders and may improve functioning better than either 
      intervention alone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are currently the only 
      medications that have consistently shown efficacy in treatment of anxiety disorders 
      in children and adolescents. Despite proven efficacy, the availability of CBT in the 
      community is limited. Current research is focusing on early identification of 
      anxiety disorders in community settings, increasing the availability of 
      evidence-based interventions, and modification of interventions for specific 
      populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
      childhood anxiety disorders, yet a significant proportion of children do not benefit 
      from it. CBT for child anxiety disorders typically includes a range of strategies 
      that may not all be applicable for all affected children. This study explored 
      whether there are distinct subgroups of children with anxiety disorders who are 
      characterized by their responses to measures of the key mechanisms that are targeted 
      in CBT (i.e. interpretation bias, perceived control, avoidance, physiological 
      arousal, and social communication). METHODS: 379 clinically anxious children (7-12 
      years) provided indices of threat interpretation, perceived control, expected 
      negative emotions and avoidance and measures of heart rate recovery following a 
      speech task. Parents also reported on their children's social communication 
      difficulties using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). RESULTS: Latent 
      profile analysis identified three groups, reflecting (i) 'Typically anxious' (the 
      majority of the sample and more likely to have Generalized anxiety disorder); (ii) 
      'social difficulties' (characterized by high SCQ and more likely to have social 
      anxiety disorder and be male); (iii) 'Avoidant' (characterized by low threat 
      interpretation but high avoidance and low perceived control). LIMITATIONS: Some 
      measures may have been influenced by confounding variables (e.g. physical 
      variability in heart rate recovery). Sample characteristics of the group may limit 
      the generalizability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically anxious children appear 
      to fall in to subgroups that might benefit from more targeted treatments that focus 
      on specific maintenance factors. Treatment studies are now required to establish 
      whether this approach would lead to more effective and efficient treatments.

TI  - Assessment and management of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
PG  - 674-8
AB  - Anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence are extremely common and are often 
      associated with lifelong psychiatric disturbance. Consistent with DSM-5 and the 
      extant literature, this review concerns the assessment and treatment of specific 
      phobias, separation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety 
      disorder, panic disorder and agoraphobia. Evidence-based psychological treatments 
      (cognitive behaviour therapy; CBT) for these disorders have been developed and 
      investigated, and in recent years promising low-intensity versions of CBT 
      interventions have been proposed that offer a means to increase access to 
      evidence-based treatments. There is some evidence of effectiveness of 
      pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people, 
      however, routine prescription is not recommended due to concerns about potential 
      harm.

TI  - Evaluation of an open-access CBT-based Internet program for social anxiety: Patterns 
      of use, retention, and outcomes.
PG  - 988-999
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000232 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been 
      established as both efficacious and effective in reducing symptoms of social 
      anxiety. However, most research has been conducted in controlled settings, and 
      little is known regarding the utility of such programs in an open-access format. The 
      present study examined the use, adherence, and effectiveness of Joyable, an 
      open-access, Internet-delivered, coach-supported CBT-based intervention for social 
      anxiety. METHOD: Participants were 3,384 registered users (Mage [SD] = 29.82 [7.89]; 
      54% male) that created an account between 2014 and 2016. Characteristics of use, 
      factors related to attrition and adherence, and within-group outcomes were examined. 
      The primary outcome measure was the Social Phobia Inventory. RESULTS: On average, 
      participants remained in the program for 81.02 days (SD = 60.50), during which they 
      completed 12.14 activities (SD = 11.09) and 1.53 exposures (SD = 3.18). About half 
      (57%) had contact with a coach. Full adherence to the program was achieved by 16% of 
      participants, a rate higher than previously published open-access studies of ICBT. 
      Social anxiety symptoms were significantly reduced for participants that engaged in 
      the program, with medium within-group effects from baseline through the cognitive 
      restructuring module (d = 0.63-0.76) and large effects from baseline through the 
      exposure module (d = 1.40-1.83). Response rates were high (72%). Exposures and coach 
      contact were significant predictors of retention and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      open-access online CBT-based program is effective in reducing social anxiety 
      symptoms and has the potential to extend Internet-based mental health services to 
      socially anxious individuals unwilling or unable to seek face-to-face evidence-based 
      therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Child and Adolescent Adherence With Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety: 
      Predictors and Associations With Outcomes.
PG  - S215-S226
LID - 10.1080/15374416.2017.1310046 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders is effective, but 
      nonadherence with treatment may reduce the benefits of CBT. This study examined (a) 
      four baseline domains (i.e., demographic, youth clinical characteristics, therapy 
      related, family/parent factors) as predictors of youth adherence with treatment and 
      (b) the associations between youth adherence and treatment outcomes. Data were from 
      279 youth (7-17 years of age, 51.6% female; 79.6% White, 9% African American), with 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) diagnoses 
      of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia, 
      who participated in CBT in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study. Adherence 
      was defined in three ways (session attendance, therapist-rated compliance, and 
      homework completion). Multiple regressions revealed several significant predictors 
      of youth adherence with CBT, but predictors varied according to the definition of 
      adherence. The most robust predictors of greater adherence were living with both 
      parents and fewer youth comorbid externalizing disorders. With respect to outcomes, 
      therapist ratings of higher youth compliance with CBT predicted several indices of 
      favorable outcome: lower anxiety severity, higher global functioning, and treatment 
      responder status after 12 weeks of CBT. Number of sessions attended and homework 
      completion did not predict treatment outcomes. Findings provide information about 
      risks for youth nonadherence, which can inform treatment and highlight the 
      importance of youth compliance with participating in therapy activities, rather than 
      just attending sessions or completing homework assignments.

TI  - Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
PG  - CD004690
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004690.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous Cochrane review (James 2005) showed that cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; 
      however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus non-CBT 
      active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and the 
      combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long-term effects of 
      CBT.  OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood 
      and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait-list controls; (b) 
      active non-CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, bibliotherapy and treatment 
      as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the combination of medication and CBT versus 
      placebo; and (2) the long-term effects of CBT. SEARCH METHODS: Searches for this 
      review included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the 
      Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant 
      randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases－The Cochrane Library 
      (1970 to July 2012), EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and 
      PsycINFO (1970 to July 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of CBT versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were 
      reviewed. All participants must have met the criteria of the Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for 
      an anxiety diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder and elective mutism. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers 
      independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the 
      odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects model, 
      with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was used. 
      Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child's anxiety symptoms 
      were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one 
      studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies 
      involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in 
      university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of 
      remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, 
      intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR 
      of 0.13 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.19, Z = 10.26, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate 
      heterogeneity (P = 0.04, I² = 33%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 6.0 (95% CI 
      7.5 to 4.6). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and 
      family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than 
      non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing 
      anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow-up 
      studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis 
      are not statistically significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural 
      therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; 
      however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or 
      TAU or medication at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment of social phobia: new advances.
PG  - 289-96
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for social phobia is an effective treatment for 
      many patients, but some patients do not benefit from the treatments and many remain 
      symptomatic. Therefore, researchers have been examining techniques that may improve 
      treatment outcome. In this paper, recent psychopathology and treatment outcome 
      research, much of which supports the expectation that a second-generation CBT 
      treatment may further improve outcome, are discussed. Finally, the authors present a 
      number of CBT techniques that are tailored for the individual treatment of patients 
      with social phobia. These methods, based on comprehensive CBT developed by Foa et 
      al. and on cognitive therapy for social phobia developed by Clark et al. include 
      developing an idiographic model for the patient, conducting safety behaviors 
      experiments, providing video feedback after cognitive preparation, developing a 
      hierarchy, conducting in vivo exposures and other behavioral experiments, imaginal 
      exposure, social skills training, assertiveness training, and behavioral activation 
      for depression.

TI  - Sleep quality predicts treatment outcome in CBT for social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 1114-20
LID - 10.1002/da.22170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep quality may be an important, yet relatively neglected, predictor 
      of treatment outcome in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders. 
      Specifically, poor sleep quality may impair memory consolidation of in-session 
      extinction learning. We therefore examined sleep quality as a predictor of treatment 
      outcome in CBT for social anxiety disorder and the impact of d-cycloserine (DCS) on 
      this relationship. METHODS: One hundred sixty-nine participants with a primary 
      diagnosis of DSM-IV generalized social anxiety disorder were recruited across three 
      sites. Participants were enrolled in 12 weeks of group CBT. Participants randomly 
      received 50 mg of DCS (n = 87) or pill placebo (n = 82) 1 hr prior to sessions 3-7. 
      Participants completed a baseline measure of self-reported sleep quality and daily 
      diaries recording subjective feelings of being rested upon wakening. Outcome 
      measures including social anxiety symptoms and global severity scores were assessed 
      at each session. RESULTS: Poorer baseline sleep quality was associated with slower 
      improvement and higher posttreatment social anxiety symptom and severity scores. 
      Moreover, patients who felt more "rested" after sleeping the night following a 
      treatment session had lower levels of symptoms and global severity at the next 
      session, controlling for their symptoms and severity scores the previous session. 
      Neither of these effects were moderated by DCS condition. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      suggest that poor sleep quality diminishes the effects of CBT for social anxiety 
      disorder and this relation is not attenuated by DCS administration. Therapeutic 
      attention to sleep quality prior to initiation of CBT and during the acute treatment 
      phase may be clinically indicated.

TI  - Cognitive behavior therapy versus supportive therapy in social phobia: a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 137-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in social phobia has 
      been demonstrated in several controlled trials and meta-analyses, but no comparison 
      of CBT with supportive therapy (ST) can be found in the literature. METHOD: The aim 
      of the trial was to study the effectiveness of CBT versus ST carried out 'as usual'. 
      Sixty-seven DSM-4 social phobic patients (89% generalized subtype, most with 
      avoidant personality) were randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1 (CBT) 
      received 8 1-hour sessions of individual cognitive therapy (CT) for 6 weeks, 
      followed by 6 2-hour sessions of social skills training (SST) in group weekly. Group 
      2 received ST for 12 weeks (6 half-hour sessions), then the patients were switched 
      to CBT. All patients agreed not to take any medication during the whole trial. In 
      group 1, 29 patients reached week 6, 27 reached week 12, and 24 weeks 36 and 60 
      (endpoint). In group 2, 29 patients reached week 6, 28 reached weeks 12 and 18, 26 
      week 24, and 23 reached weeks 48 and 72 (endpoint). RESULTS: At week 6, after CT, 
      group 1 was better than group 2 on the main social phobia measure. At week 12, after 
      SST, group 1 was better than group 2 on most of the measures and demonstrated a 
      significantly higher rate of responders. This finding was replicated after switching 
      group 2 to CBT. Sustained improvement was observed in both groups at follow-up. 
      Compliance with abstinence from medication increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: CBT was 
      more effective than ST and demonstrated long-lasting effects. This may suggest that 
      social phobia management requires more than a simple and inexpensive psychological 
      intervention.

TI  - The outcome of children with selective mutism following cognitive behavioral 
      intervention: a follow-up study.
PG  - 481-7
LID - 10.1007/s00431-015-2651-0 [doi]
AB  - Selective mutism (SM) is a relatively rare childhood disorder and is underdiagnosed 
      and undertreated. The purpose of the retrospective naturalistic study was to examine 
      the long-term outcome of children with SM who were treated with specifically 
      designed modular cognitive behavioral therapy (MCBT). Parents of 36 children who met 
      diagnostic criteria of SM that received MCBT treatment were invited for a follow-up 
      evaluation. Parents were interviewed using structured scales and completed 
      questionnaires regarding the child, including the Selective Mutism Questionnaire 
      (SMQ). Twenty-four subjects were identified and evaluated. Their mean age ± SD of 
      onset of SM symptoms, beginning of treatment, and age at follow-up were 3.4 ± 1.4, 
      6.4 ± 3.1, and 9.3 ± 3.4 years, respectively. There was robust improvement from 
      beginning of treatment to follow-up evaluation in SM, social anxiety disorder, and 
      specific phobia symptoms. The recovery rate from SM was 84.2 %. CONCLUSION: 
      SM-focused MCBT is feasible in children and possibly effective in inducing long-term 
      reduction of SM and comorbid anxiety symptoms. WHAT IS KNOWN: • There are limited 
      empirical data on selective mutism (SM) treatment outcome and specifically on 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, with the majority of studies being uncontrolled case 
      reports of 1 to 2 cases each. • There is also limited data on the long-term outcome 
      of children with SM following treatment. What is New: • Modular cognitive behavioral 
      treatment is a feasible and possibly effective treatment for SM. Intervention at a 
      younger age is more effective comparing to an older age. • Treatment for SM also 
      decreases the rate of psychiatric comorbidities, including separation anxiety 
      disorder and specific phobia.

      therapy in social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 1114-1122
LID - 10.1002/da.22540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) versus psychodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of social anxiety disorder 
      after a follow-up of 30 months from a societal perspective. METHODS: This analysis 
      was conducted alongside the multicenter SOPHO-NET trial; adults with a primary 
      diagnosis of social anxiety disorder received CBT (n = 209) or PDT (n = 207). Data 
      on health care utilization and productivity loss were collected at baseline, after 6 
      months (posttreatment), and three further follow-ups to calculate direct and 
      indirect costs. Anxiety-free days (AFDs) calculated based on remission and response 
      were used as measure of effect. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
      determined. Net benefit regressions, adjusted for comorbidities and baseline 
      differences, were applied to derive cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. 
      RESULTS: In the descriptive analysis, the unadjusted ICER favored CBT over PDT and 
      the adjusted analysis showed that CBT's cost-effectiveness relative to PDT depends 
      on the willingness to pay (WTP) per AFD. As baseline costs differed substantially 
      the unadjusted estimates might be deceptive. If additional WTPs for CBT of €0, €10, 
      and €30 were assumed, the probability of CBT being cost-effective relative to PDT 
      was 65, 83, and 96%. Direct costs increased compared to baseline across groups, 
      whereas indirect costs did not change significantly. Results were sensitive to 
      considered costs. CONCLUSIONS: If the society is willing to pay ≥€30 per additional 
      AFD, CBT can be considered cost-effective, relative to PDT, with certainty. To 
      further increase the cost-effectiveness more knowledge regarding predictors of 
      treatment outcome seems essential.

TI  - The feasibility and acceptability of a novel anxiety in bipolar disorder 
      intervention compared to treatment as usual: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 953-965
LID - 10.1002/da.22781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbid anxiety is common in bipolar disorder (BD) and associated with 
      worse clinical outcomes including increased suicidality. Despite effective 
      psychological treatments for anxiety, research into treating anxiety in BD is 
      underdeveloped. This paper describes a novel psychological intervention to address 
      anxiety in context of bipolar disorder (AIBD). METHODS: Adults with BD and 
      clinically significant anxiety symptoms were randomized to AIBD plus treatment as 
      usual (TAU) or TAU alone. AIBD offered 10 sessions of psychological therapy using a 
      formulation-based approach. Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated through 
      recruitment, retention, therapy attendance, alliance, fidelity, and qualitative 
      feedback. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 16, 48, and 80 weeks: interim 
      assessments of relapse at 32 and 64 weeks. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants were 
      recruited with 88% retention to 16 weeks and 74% to 80 weeks (similar between arms). 
      Therapy participants attended <mml:math 
      xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> 
      <mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>x</mml:mi> <mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover> 
      <mml:mspace/></mml:mrow> </mml:math> 7.7 (SD 2.8) sessions. Therapeutic alliance and 
      therapy fidelity were acceptable. Qualitative interviews indicated that participants 
      valued integrated support for anxiety with BD and coping strategies. Some suggested 
      a longer intervention period. Clinical outcomes were not significantly different 
      between arms up to 80 weeks follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: AIBD is feasible and acceptable 
      but lack of impact on clinical outcomes indicates that adaptations are required. 
      These are discussed in relation to qualitative feedback and recent literature 
      published since the trial completed.

TI  - Quality of and patient satisfaction with primary health care for anxiety disorders.
PG  - 970-6

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with anxiety disorders receive their care from primary 
      care practitioners (PCPs). The purpose of this study was to evaluate quality of and 
      patient satisfaction with primary health care for anxiety disorders. METHOD: A 
      survey was performed among 1,004 outpatients with anxiety disorders (diagnosed 
      according to DSM-IV) referred by their PCPs from 17 primary care clinical settings 
      (3 of which were university-affiliated) in 4 regions of the United States for 
      participation in the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) study, a 
      therapeutic trial. Participating research institutions were the University of 
      Washington at Seattle, the University of California at San Diego and Los Angeles, 
      and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at Little Rock. Enrollment took 
      place between June 2006 and April 2008. Patients were contacted by telephone after 
      enrollment to provide information about previous care received (during the 6 months 
      prior to referral) and satisfaction with that care. Quality-of-care indicators were 
      self-reported type, dose, and duration of antianxiety medication treatment and 
      self-reported psychotherapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) elements. 
      RESULTS: A total of 576 patients (57.4%) had received an appropriate antianxiety 
      medication in the previous 6 months, but only 289 patients (29.4% of 983 who 
      answered this question) had received the medication at adequate dose for at least 2 
      months. A total of 465 patients (46.3%) had received some counseling with at least 1 
      element of CBT, but only 213 patients (21.2%) had received counseling with a strong 
      (3+ elements) CBT focus. Overall, 416 patients (41.4%) had received quality 
      pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, and 81 patients (8.1%) had received both. Only 432 
      patients (44.8% of 964 who answered this question) were at least somewhat satisfied 
      with their mental health care. Receipt of quality psychotherapy was the sole 
      positive predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.71; 95% CI, 1.94-3.80; P < .0005) of 
      satisfaction with mental health care for anxiety. Moreover, there was a 
      dose-response relationship between the number of CBT elements consistently delivered 
      and satisfaction with care (test for trend, z = 4.06, P < .0005). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite recognition of these patients' anxiety disorders and referral by their PCPs 
      to an anxiety treatment study, fewer than half of the patients had in the prior 6 
      months received quality pharmacologic and/or psychosocial mental health care. 
      Receipt of CBT-oriented, quality psychosocial (but not pharmacologic) care showed a 
      strong dose-response relationship with satisfaction with mental health care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) commonly 
      co-occur in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), yet whether these 
      comorbidities influence the outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD 
      is unclear. METHODS: The present study examined the degree to which individuals with 
      SAD and comorbid MDD (SAD+MDD; n=76), comorbid BD (SAD+BD; n=19), a comorbid anxiety 
      disorder (SAD+ANX; n=27), or no comorbid diagnoses (SAD+NCO; n=41) benefitted from 
      CBT for SAD. Individuals were screened using the Structured Clinical Interview for 
      DSM-IV and then completed the Social Phobia Inventory and the Depression Anxiety 
      Stress Scales before and after 12-weeks of group CBT for SAD. RESULTS: At 
      pretreatment the SAD+MDD and SAD+BD groups reported higher social anxiety symptoms 
      than the SAD+ANX and SAD+NCO groups. All groups reported large and significant 
      improvement in social anxiety with CBT. However, at posttreatment the SAD+MDD and 
      SAD+BD groups continued to have higher social anxiety symptoms than the SAD+NCO 
      group, and the SAD+ANX group did not differ in social anxiety symptoms from any 
      group. The sample also showed small and statistically significant improvement in 
      depressive symptoms with CBT for SAD. LIMITATIONS: Information about medication was 
      not collected in the present study, and we did not assess the long-term effects of 
      CBT. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CBT for SAD is an effective treatment even 
      in the presence of comorbid mood disorders in the short-term, although extending the 
      course of treatment may be helpful for this population and should be investigated in 
      future research.

TI  - The therapeutic relationship in cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy for 
      anxious youth.
PG  - 859-64
LID - 10.1037/a0033294 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the therapeutic relationship with cognitive-behavioral 
      therapists and with pharmacotherapists for youth from the Child/Adolescent Anxiety 
      Multimodal Study (Walkup et al., 2008). The therapeutic relationship was examined in 
      relation to treatment outcomes. METHOD: Participants were 488 youth (ages 7-17 
      years; 50% male) randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping Cat), 
      pharmacotherapy (sertraline), their combination, or placebo pill. Participants met 
      criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety 
      disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th 
      ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The therapeutic relationship was 
      assessed by youth report at Weeks 6 and 12 of treatment using the Child's Perception 
      of Therapeutic Relationship scale (Kendall et al., 1997). Outcome measures 
      (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale; Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology 
      Anxiety Study Group, 2002; and Clinical Global Impressions Scales; Guy, 1976) were 
      completed by independent evaluators blind to condition. RESULTS: For youth who 
      received CBT only, a stronger therapeutic relationship predicted positive treatment 
      outcome. In contrast, the therapeutic relationship did not predict outcome for youth 
      receiving sertraline, combined treatment, or placebo. CONCLUSION: A therapeutic 
      relationship may be important for anxious youth who receive CBT alone.

TI  - Recent advances in understanding and treating social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 24-33
AB  - The common occurrence and high level of morbidity and burden associated with social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD) are gaining widespread recognition. Interest in understanding 
      and treating the disorder has also grown in response to large-scale investigations 
      that have demonstrated high levels of efficacy with both pharmacologic and 
      nonpharmacologic treatments. Such trials indicate that many patients with 
      generalized SAD (roughly 40% to 60%) respond (eg, Clinical Global 
      Impressions-Improvement rating 1 or 2) after an adequate treatment trial, despite 
      having suffered with disabling symptoms for most of their adult lives. First-line 
      therapy options include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the 
      dual-acting serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. Second-line 
      options consist of anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, valproic acid) and 
      benzodiazepines (clonazepam). Reversible and irreversible monoamine oxidase 
      inhibitors (moclobemide and phenelzine, respectively), while effective, are not 
      widely used. Nonpharmacologic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT), are also effective for SAD. Newer treatment strategies such as levetiracetam, 
      atypical antipsychotics, or D-cycloserine in combination with CBT appear promising 
      but require further investigation. Finding a well-tolerated, safe, and effective 
      treatment for each individual patient is crucial as most will require ongoing 
      treatment in order to maintain benefits, prevent SAD relapse, and to experience 
      optimal outcomes in the long term.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the short-term cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy (PDT) compared to waiting list (WL). 
      METHODS: The analysis was conducted alongside the SOPHO-NET multi-center efficacy 
      trial. Patients were randomly assigned to CBT (n=209), PDT (n=207), or WL (n=79). 
      Resource use was assessed prior and during treatment to determine direct and 
      absenteeism costs. Unadjusted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
      calculated based on remission and response rates. To visualize statistical 
      uncertainty, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were constructed based 
      on adjusted net-benefit regression. Different values for the society׳s willingness 
      to pay (WTP) were assumed. RESULTS: Both interventions were more efficacious than WL 
      but were associated with increased direct costs besides intervention costs. 
      Unadjusted ICERs per responder were €3615 for CBT and €4958 for PDT. Unadjusted 
      ICERs per remitted patient were €5788 and €10,733. CEACs revealed a high degree of 
      uncertainty: applying the 97.5% probability threshold, CBT proved cost-effective at 
      a WTP ≥€16,100 per responder and ≥€26,605 per remitted patient. Regarding PDT 
      cost-effectiveness only was certain for response at a WTP ≥€27,290. LIMITATIONS: The 
      WL condition is assumed to represent untreated patients, although the expectation to 
      start treatment in the near future probably affects symptom severity and health care 
      utilization. CONCLUSIONS: At the end of treatment cost-effectiveness of CBT and PDT 
      compared to WL is uncertain and depends on the societal WTP. The interventions may 
      induce a more adequate utilization of other health care services - involving 
      increased costs. Development of costs and effects in the long-run should be 
      considered.

TI  - Medical student attitudes and educational interventions to prevent neurophobia: a 
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 225

AB  - BACKGROUND: With an aging American population, the burden of neurologic disease is 
      intensifying and the decline in neurology residents and practicing neurologists is 
      leaving these patients helpless and unable to find care. 'Neurophobia', a chronic 
      illness that begins early in medical school, has been identified as a cause for the 
      low number of neurology residents. METHODS: A longitudinal study surveyed medical 
      students at the beginning of their first year (M1) and then again at the beginning 
      of their second year (M2). Three neuroscience educational interventions were 
      studied: team based learning (TBL), case based teaching (CBT), and problem based 
      learning (PBL). Participants provided self-reported neurophobia levels, attitudes 
      about neuroscience, and the effectiveness of educational interventions. RESULTS: A 
      total of 446 students during M1 and 206 students during M2 participated in the 
      survey. A significant change in self-reported neurophobia (p = 0.035) was observed 
      from 19% in M1 to 26% in M2. Neuroscience knowledge and confidence managing a 
      neurologic condition also significantly increased (p < 0.001 and p = 0.038 
      respectively). Perceived interest, difficulty, and desire to pursue a career in 
      neuroscience did not a change significantly. Majority of students perceived CBT 
      (76%), TBL (56%), and PBL (66%) beneficial. Only CBT demonstrated a statistical 
      difference (p = 0.026) when stratified by self-reported change in neurophobia. 
      CONCLUSION: An increase in neurophobia after completing a neuroscience was observed 
      but the prevalence rate of 26% was lower than previous studies. Knowledge about 
      neuroscience increased significantly and educational interventions were considered 
      beneficial by students. Thus, interventions that increase knowledge and decrease 
      neurophobia can lead to an increase in students pursuing neurology residencies.

PG  - 171-83

AB  - Pediatric generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and 
      uncontrollable worry about a variety of events and is accompanied by physical 
      symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, and 
      heart palpitations. Symptoms impose marked distress and interfere with social, 
      emotional, and educational functioning. GAD occurs in over 10% of children and 
      adolescents, has an average age of onset of 8.5 years, and is more often reported in 
      girls. Common co-occurring conditions include separation anxiety disorder and social 
      phobia. Assessment involves a multi-informant, multi-method approach involving the 
      child, parents, and school teachers. A clinical interview should be conducted to 
      assess for the three primary ways anxiety presents: behaviors, thoughts, and somatic 
      symptoms. Several semi-structured diagnostic interviews are available, and the 
      Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule is increasingly used. Rating scales completed 
      by the patient, caregivers, and teachers provide useful information for diagnosis 
      and symptom monitoring. Several scales are available to assess patients for the 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition) GAD diagnosis; 
      however, instruments generally cannot distinguish children with GAD from children 
      with similar anxiety disorders. Both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have demonstrated efficacy for the 
      treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders including GAD. Evidence suggests that the 
      combination of CBT plus sertraline offers additional benefit compared with either 
      treatment alone. With pharmacotherapy, systematic tracking of treatment-emergent 
      adverse events such as headaches, stomach aches, behavioral activation, worsening 
      symptoms, and emerging suicidal thoughts is important. Recommended starting doses 
      are fluvoxamine 25 mg/day, fluoxetine 10 mg/day, and sertraline 25 mg/day, though 
      lower starting doses are possible. Dosing can be adjusted as often as weekly with 
      the goal of achieving a high-quality response, while minimizing side effects. 
      Long-term treatment with medication has not been well studied; however, to achieve 
      optimal long-term outcome extended use of medication may be required. It is 
      recommended to continue medication for approximately 1 year following remission in 
      symptoms, and when discontinuing medication to choose a stress-free time of the 
      year. If symptoms return, medication re-initiation should be considered seriously.

PG  - e98118

LID - e98118
AB  - BACKGROUND: Greater access to evidence-based psychological treatments is needed. 
      This review aimed to evaluate whether internet-delivered psychological treatments 
      for mood and anxiety disorders are efficacious, noninferior to established 
      treatments, safe, and cost-effective for children, adolescents and adults. METHODS: 
      We searched the literature for studies published until March 2013. Randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) were considered for the assessment of short-term efficacy 
      and safety and were pooled in meta-analyses. Other designs were also considered for 
      long-term effect and cost-effectiveness. Comparisons against established treatments 
      were evaluated for noninferiority. Two reviewers independently assessed the relevant 
      studies for risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was graded using an 
      international grading system. RESULTS: A total of 52 relevant RCTs were identified 
      whereof 12 were excluded due to high risk of bias. Five cost-effectiveness studies 
      were identified and three were excluded due to high risk of bias. The included 
      trials mainly evaluated internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (I-CBT) 
      against a waiting list in adult volunteers and 88% were conducted in Sweden or 
      Australia. One trial involved children. For adults, the quality of evidence was 
      graded as moderate for the short-term efficacy of I-CBT vs. waiting list for 
      mild/moderate depression (d = 0.83; 95% CI 0.59, 1.07) and social phobia (d = 0.85; 
      95% CI 0.66, 1.05), and moderate for no efficacy of internet-delivered attention 
      bias modification vs. sham treatment for social phobia (d =  -0.04; 95% CI -0.24, 
      0.35). The quality of evidence was graded as low/very low for other disorders, 
      interventions, children/adolescents, noninferiority, adverse events, and 
      cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: I-CBT is a viable treatment option for adults with 
      depression and some anxiety disorders who request this treatment modality. Important 
      questions remain before broad implementation can be supported. Future research would 
      benefit from prioritizing adapting treatments to children/adolescents and using 
      noninferiority designs with established forms of treatment.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of body dysmorphic disorder in adolescents.
PG  - 108-13
AB  - Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is an underrecognized and underdiagnosed problem that 
      is relatively common among adolescents. Although the onset of the disorder occurs in 
      adolescence, BDD research in child and adolescent psychiatry is relatively limited. 
      Body dysmorphic disorder has a high rate of co-morbidity with depression and 
      suicide, which indicates important implications for prompt diagnosis and treatment 
      in adolescents with BDD. Effective treatment options include cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). This 
      paper provides a brief overview of BDD in adolescents, presents and evaluates the 
      most recent literature on approaches to diagnosis and treatment, and highlights some 
      of the characteristics that distinguish BDD from other disorders such as 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, depression, and eating disorders.

BTI - Internet-Based Psychological Treatment for Anxiety and Mood Disorders
AB  - It is not evident whether psychological treatment via the internet is non-inferior 
      to corresponding treatment by a therapist. Internet-based cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT), with the support of a therapist, reduces symptoms in adults with 
      social phobia or mild to moderate major depression, and who have themselves sought 
      this form of treatment. There is some evidence that this also applies to panic 
      disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. Most trials have compared the treatment 
      only with waiting lists and have short follow-up periods. Further trials are needed 
      to assess the effect of treatment in the longer term. Given our present level of 
      knowledge, internet-based CBT with therapist support may be considered as part of a 
      wider range of psychological methods for these conditions and mainly for patients 
      who are motivated to seek this form of treatment. Treatment costs for internet-based 
      CBT in the short term are probably lower than for CBT in a group or individually. 
      However, since the effects of these treatment alternatives have not been adequately 
      compared, it is not possible to ascertain which alternative is cost-effective. It is 
      important to investigate whether this type of treatment can reach people who are in 
      need of care but who are not currently being treated through ordinary health and 
      medical care. In order to further clarify what role internet-based treatment might 
      have in the care of anxiety and mood disorders, it is also important to clarify the 
      extent to which internet-based treatment is requested by patients. More and 
      larger-scale studies are required in order to assess: whether internet-based 
      psychological treatment has an effect that is non-inferior to that of established 
      psychological treatment methods; what risks might be involved in participating in 
      internet-based treatment; what effect internet-based psychological treatment has on 
      anxiety and mood disorders in children and adolescents; the effect of types of 
      internet-based psychological treatment other than CBT with therapist support; 
      whether there are groups of patients for whom treatment via the internet is more or 
      less appropriate.

TI  - Benefits of child-focused anxiety treatments for parents and family functioning.
PG  - 865-72
LID - 10.1002/da.22055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine (1) changes in parent (global psychological distress, trait 
      anxiety) and family (dysfunction, burden) functioning following 12 weeks of 
      child-focused anxiety treatment, and (2) whether changes in these parent and family 
      factors were associated with child's treatment condition and response. METHODS: 
      Participants were 488 youth ages 7-17 years (50% female; mean age 10.7 years) who 
      met DSM-IV-TR criteria for social phobia, separation anxiety, and/or generalized 
      anxiety disorder, and their parents. Youth were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of 
      "Coping Cat" individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication management 
      with sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or medication management with pill 
      placebo (PBO) within the multisite Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). 
      At pre- and posttreatment, parents completed measures of trait anxiety, 
      psychological distress, family functioning, and burden of child illness; children 
      completed a measure of family functioning. Blinded independent evaluators rated 
      child's response to treatment using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale 
      at posttreatment. RESULTS: Analyses of covariance revealed that parental 
      psychological distress and trait anxiety, and parent-reported family dysfunction 
      improved only for parents of children who were rated as treatment responders, and 
      these changes were unrelated to treatment condition. Family burden and 
      child-reported family dysfunction improved significantly from pre- to posttreatment 
      regardless of treatment condition or response. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that 
      child-focused anxiety treatments, regardless of intervention condition, can result 
      in improvements in nontargeted parent symptoms and family functioning particularly 
      when children respond successfully to the treatment.

TI  - D-Cycloserine as an augmentation strategy with cognitive-behavioral therapy for 
      social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 751-8
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12070974 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined whether D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the 
      glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, augments and accelerates a full course 
      of comprehensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in adults with generalized 
      social anxiety disorder. METHOD: This was a multisite randomized placebo-controlled 
      efficacy study with 169 medication-free adults with generalized social anxiety 
      disorder, of whom 144 completed the 12-week treatment and 131 completed the three 
      follow-up assessments. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg of 
      D-cycloserine or placebo 1 hour before each of five exposure sessions that were part 
      of a 12-session cognitive-behavioral group treatment. Response and remission status 
      was determined at baseline, throughout treatment, at end of treatment, and at 1-, 
      3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments by assessors who were blind to treatment 
      condition. RESULTS: D-Cycloserine-augmented and placebo-augmented CBT were 
      associated with similar completion rates (87% and 82%), response rates (79.3% and 
      73.3%), and remission rates (34.5% and 24.4%) at the posttreatment assessment; 
      response and remission rates were largely maintained at the follow-up assessments. 
      Although D-cycloserine was associated with a 24%-33% faster rate of improvement in 
      symptom severity and remission rates relative to placebo during the treatment phase, 
      the groups did not differ in response and remission rates. CONCLUSIONS: 
      D-Cycloserine did not augment a full course of comprehensive CBT for social anxiety 
      disorder.

TI  - Incremental benefits and cost of coordinated anxiety learning and management for 
      anxiety treatment in primary care.
PG  - 1937-48
LID - 10.1017/S0033291711002893 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving the quality of mental health care requires integrating 
      successful research interventions into 'real-world' practice settings. Coordinated 
      Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) is a treatment-delivery model for anxiety 
      disorders encountered in primary care. CALM offers cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT), medication, or both; non-expert care managers assisting primary care 
      clinicians with adherence promotion and medication optimization; computer-assisted 
      CBT delivery; and outcome monitoring. This study describes incremental benefits, 
      costs and net benefits of CALM versus usual care (UC). METHOD: The CALM randomized, 
      controlled effectiveness trial was conducted in 17 primary care clinics in four US 
      cities from 2006 to 2009. Of 1062 eligible patients, 1004 English- or 
      Spanish-speaking patients aged 18-75 years with panic disorder (PD), generalized 
      anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and/or post-traumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) with or without major depression were randomized. Anxiety-free days 
      (AFDs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and expenditures for out-patient visits, 
      emergency room (ER) visits, in-patient stays and psychiatric medications were 
      estimated based on blinded telephone assessments at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. 
      RESULTS: Over 18 months, CALM participants, on average, experienced 57.1 more AFDs 
      [95% confidence interval (CI) 31-83] and $245 additional medical expenses (95% CI 
      $-733 to $1223). The mean incremental net benefit (INB) of CALM versus UC was 
      positive when an AFD was valued ≥$4. For QALYs based on the Short-Form Health 
      Survey-12 (SF-12) and the EuroQol EQ-5D, the mean INB was positive at ≥$5000. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with UC, CALM provides significant benefits with modest 
      increases in health-care expenditures.

LID - S0887-6185(17)30361-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.janxdis.2017.11.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies examining the effect of d-cycloserine (DCS) on homework 
      compliance and outcome in cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) have yielded mixed 
      results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DCS facilitates the 
      effects of homework compliance on symptom reduction in a large-scale study for 
      social anxiety disorder (SAD). METHODS: 169 participants with generalized SAD 
      received DCS or pill placebo during 12-session exposure-based group CBT. 
      Improvements in social anxiety were assessed by independent raters at each session 
      using the Liebowitz social anxiety scale (LSAS). RESULTS: Controlling for LSAS at 
      the previous session, and irrespective of treatment condition, greater homework 
      compliance in the week prior related to lower LSAS at the next session. However, DCS 
      did not moderate the effect of homework compliance and LSAS, LSAS on homework 
      compliance, or the overall augmenting effect of DCS on homework compliance. 
      Furthermore, LSAS levels were not predictive of homework compliance in the following 
      week. CONCLUSION: The findings support the general benefits of homework compliance 
      on outcome, but not a DCS-augmenting effect. The comparably small number of 
      DCS-enhanced sessions in this study could be one reason for the failure to find a 
      facilitating effect of DCS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of adverse events (AEs) across 4 treatment 
      conditions in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), and to compare 
      the frequency of AEs between children and adolescents. METHOD: Participants ages 7 
      to 17 years (mean = 10.7 years) meeting the DSM-IV criteria for 1 or more of the 
      following disorders: separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or 
      social phobia were randomized (2:2:2:1) to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT, n = 
      139), sertraline (SRT, n = 133), a combination of both (COMB, n = 140), or pill 
      placebo (PBO, n = 76). Data on AEs were collected via a standardized inquiry method 
      plus a self-report Physical Symptom Checklist (PSC). RESULTS: There were no 
      differences between the double-blinded conditions (SRT versus PBO) for total 
      physical and psychiatric AEs or any individual physical or psychiatric AEs. The 
      rates of total physical AEs were greater in the SRT-alone treatment condition when 
      compared to CBT (p < .01) and COMB (p < .01). Moreover, those who received SRT alone 
      reported higher rates of several physical AEs when compared to COMB and CBT. The 
      rate of total psychiatric AEs was higher in children (≤12 years) across all arms 
      (31.7% versus 23.1%, p < .05). Total PSC scores decreased over time, with no 
      significant differences between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The results support 
      the tolerability/safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment 
      for anxiety disorders even after adjusting for the number of reporting 
      opportunities, leading to no differences in overall rates of AEs. Few differences 
      occurred on specific items. Additional monitoring of psychiatric AEs is recommended 
      in children (≤12 years). Clinical trial registration information-Child and 
      Adolescent Anxiety Disorders (CAMS); http://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00052078.

PG  - 987-97
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy demonstrate efficacy across 
      the anxiety disorders, but recognition of their limitations has sparked interest in 
      combining modalities to maximize benefit. This article reviews the empirical 
      literature to examine whether combining treatments influences efficacy of either 
      monotherapy. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of published randomized 
      trials that compared combined treatment with pharmacologic or CBT monotherapies. Ten 
      studies that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed in detail, and within-subjects 
      effect sizes were calculated to compare treatment conditions within and across 
      studies. At posttreatment and follow-up, effect size and percentage responder data 
      failed to clearly demonstrate an advantage or disadvantage of combined treatment 
      over CBT alone for obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, and generalized 
      anxiety disorder. Some advantage of combined treatment over pharmacotherapy alone 
      emerged from the few studies that allowed for such a direct comparison. In contrast, 
      combined treatment for panic disorder seems to provide an advantage over CBT alone 
      at posttreatment, but is associated with greater relapse after treatment 
      discontinuation. The advantage of combined treatment may vary across the anxiety 
      disorders. The potential differences in usefulness of combined treatment are 
      discussed, directions for future research are suggested, and implications for 
      clinical practice are considered.

TI  - Does respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) predict anxiety reduction during cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD)?

AB  - Modifying dysfunctional emotion regulation is an important goal in psychological 
      treatments for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Antecedent-focused strategies learned 
      in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), such as cognitive reappraisal, have proven 
      more effective in reducing social anxiety than response-focused strategies, such as 
      expressive suppression. Still, not all patients with SAD respond well to CBT. 
      Medications and physiological factors may also influence the clinical response. The 
      purpose of the present study was to examine the role that these factors play in 
      determining treatment response following CBT for SAD. Using multilevel modeling, we 
      examined associations across four separate laboratory visits between change in 
      self-reported anxiety and indices of reappraisal, suppression, medication status, 
      and resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a proxy measure of self-regulatory 
      capacity, in 23 socially anxious adults during a 12-week program of CBT. Most 
      participants were ultimately classified as responders to CBT (n=15), but in some, 
      anxiety levels remained unchanged (n=8). Medication use explained substantial 
      variance related to individual differences in anxiety among participants. When 
      modeled separately, reappraisal, suppression, and RSA each accounted for significant 
      variance related to anxiety. However, the best-fitting model included reappraisal 
      and RSA. Moreover, RSA reactivity (change in RSA levels over time) was more 
      important for predicting anxiety reduction than were baseline levels of RSA. These 
      findings suggest that reappraisal and parasympathetic responsiveness may be 
      important in reducing anxiety in adults with SAD who respond well to CBT.

PG  - 79-89

AB  - This study examined the relationship between caregivers' and youths' treatment 
      expectations and characteristics of exposure tasks (quantity, mastery, compliance) 
      in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety. Additionally, 
      compliance with exposure tasks was tested as a mediator of the relationship between 
      treatment expectations and symptom improvement. Data were from youth (N = 279; 
      7-17 years old) enrolled in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) and 
      randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or the combination of CBT and 
      sertraline for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety 
      disorder, and social phobia. Caregivers and youth independently reported treatment 
      expectations prior to randomization, anxiety was assessed pre- and post-treatment by 
      independent evaluators blind to treatment condition, and exposure characteristics 
      were recorded by the cognitive-behavioral therapists following each session. For 
      both caregivers and youths, more positive expectations that anxiety would improve 
      with treatment were associated with greater compliance with exposure tasks, and 
      compliance mediated the relationship between treatment expectations and change in 
      anxiety symptoms following treatment. Additionally, more positive parent treatment 
      expectations were related to a greater number and percentage of sessions with 
      exposure. More positive youth treatment expectations were associated with greater 
      mastery during sessions focused on exposure. Findings underscore the importance of 
      addressing parents' and youths' treatment expectations at the outset of therapy to 
      facilitate engagement in exposure and maximize therapeutic gains.

TI  - Predicting cognitive behavioral therapy response in social anxiety disorder with 
      anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala during emotion regulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 
      other internalizing conditions attempts to improve emotion regulation. Accumulating 
      data indicate anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and to a lesser extent amygdala, 
      activation in various tasks predicts treatment outcome. However, little is known 
      about ACC and amygdala activation to emotion regulation in predicting clinical 
      improvement following CBT in SAD. METHODS: Before treatment, 38 SAD patients 
      completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation paradigms during fMRI. Implicit 
      regulation involved attentional control over negative distractors. Explicit 
      regulation comprised cognitive reappraisal to negative images. Pre-CBT brain 
      activity was circumscribed to anatomical-based ACC sub-regions (rostral, dorsal) and 
      amygdala masks, which were submitted to ROC curves to examine predictive validity as 
      well as correlational analysis to evaluate prognostic change in symptom severity. 
      RESULTS: More rostral (rACC) activity in implicit regulation and less rACC activity 
      during explicit regulation distinguished responders (34%) from non-responders. 
      Greater amygdala response in implicit regulation also foretold responder status. 
      Baseline rACC and amygdala activity during attentional control correlated with 
      pre-to-post CBT change in symptom severity such that more activation was related to 
      greater decline in symptoms. No significant correlations were observed for explicit 
      regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Across forms of regulation, rACC activity predicted 
      responder status whereas amygdala as a neuromarker was limited to implicit 
      regulation. While the direction of effects (enhanced vs. reduced) in rACC activity 
      was task-dependent, results suggest SAD patients with deficient regulation benefited 
      more from CBT. Findings support previous studies involving patients with depression 
      and suggest the rACC may be a viable marker of clinical improvement in SAD.

AB  - Increased error monitoring, as measured by the error-related negativity (ERN), has 
      been shown to persist after treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth and 
      adults; however, no previous studies have examined the ERN following treatment for 
      related anxiety disorders. We used a flanker task to elicit the ERN in 28 youth and 
      young adults (8-26years old) with primary diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder 
      (GAD) or social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 35 healthy controls. Patients were 
      assessed before and after treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and healthy controls were assessed 
      at a comparable interval. The ERN increased across assessments in the combined 
      sample. Patients with SAD exhibited an enhanced ERN relative to healthy controls 
      prior to and following treatment, even when analyses were limited to SAD patients 
      who responded to treatment. Patients with GAD did not significantly differ from 
      healthy controls at either assessment. Results provide preliminary evidence that 
      enhanced error monitoring persists following treatment for SAD in youth and young 
      adults, and support conceptualizations of increased error monitoring as a trait-like 
      vulnerability that may contribute to risk for recurrence and impaired functioning 
      later in life. Future work is needed to further evaluate the ERN in GAD across 
      development, including whether an enhanced ERN develops in adulthood or is most 
      apparent when worries focus on internal sources of threat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent anxiety disorders 
      in the general population. The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
      social anxiety disorders is well demonstrated. However, only three studies point to 
      the efficacy of systemic therapy (ST) in anxiety disorders, and only two of them 
      especially focus on social anxiety disorders. These ST studies either do not use a 
      good comparator but minimal supportive therapy, they do not use a multi-person ST 
      but a combined therapy, or they do not especially focus on social anxiety disorders 
      but mood and anxiety disorders in general. Though ST was approved as evidence based 
      in Germany for a variety of disorders in 2008, evidence did not include anxiety 
      disorders. This is the first pilot study that will investigate multi-person ST, 
      integrating a broad range of systemic methods, specifically for social anxiety 
      disorders and that will compare ST to the "gold standard" CBT. DESIGN: This article 
      describes the rationale and protocol of a prospective, open, interventive, balanced, 
      bi-centric, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 32 patients with a 
      primary SCID diagnosis of social anxiety disorder will be randomized to either CBT 
      or ST. Both treatments will be manualized. The primary outcome will include social 
      anxiety symptoms at the end of therapy. Therapy will be restricted to no more than 
      26 hours (primary endpoint). Secondary outcomes will include psychological, social 
      systems and interpersonal functioning, symptom adjustment, and caregiver burden, in 
      addition to change measures, therapist variables and treatment adherence. At the 
      secondary endpoints, 9 and 12 months after the beginning of therapy, we will again 
      assess all outcomes. DISCUSSION: The study is expected to pilot test a RCT which 
      will be the first to directly compare CBT and multi-person ST, integrating a broad 
      range of systemic methods, for social anxiety disorders, and it will provide 
      empirical evidence for the calculation of the number of patients needed for a 
      confirmatory RCT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02360033 ; date of 
      registration: 21 January 2015.

LID - 10.1016/j.janxdis.2014.06.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although developed as a screener for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) 
      in primary care, the GAD-7 is now commonly used as a measure of general anxiety 
      symptoms across various settings and populations. However, little is known about its 
      psychometric properties when used in such heterogeneous samples. We examined the 
      internal consistency, convergent validity, sensitivity and specificity, sensitivity 
      to change, and structure of the GAD-7 in patients receiving brief, intensive CBT 
      treatment in a partial hospital setting. We also examined the properties of a 
      modified version that assessed symptoms over the past 24-h. METHODS: Participants 
      (n=1082) completed the GAD-7 upon admission and discharge from a partial hospital 
      program. They also completed measures of worry, depression, and well being and a 
      structured diagnostic interview. We examined psychometric properties in the total 
      sample and separately for patients with GAD, post-traumatic stress disorder, Social 
      Anxiety Disorder (SAD), and panic disorder. RESULTS: Internal consistency and 
      convergent validity were good for the total sample and each anxiety disorder group. 
      The GAD-7 demonstrated poor specificity and a high false positive rate for all 
      anxiety disorders. Sensitivity to change was generally good. Factor analysis 
      revealed that a one-factor structure did not fit the data well. The 24-h version 
      performed similarly to the original version. CONCLUSIONS: The GAD-7 performed well 
      as a measure of anxiety symptom severity, but not as a screener in this psychiatric 
      sample. It is a useful outcome measure for hetereogenous samples, but it may not 
      perform as well specifically for individuals with SAD. A modified version of the 
      GAD-7 that assessed anxiety symptoms over the past 24-h appears to be a reliable and 
      valid modification.

TI  - An Experimental Comparison of Techniques: Cognitive Defusion, Cognitive 
      Restructuring, and in-vivo Exposure for Social Anxiety.
PG  - 249-54
LID - 10.1017/S1352465814000630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the primary differences between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 
      (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for anxiety is the approach to 
      managing negative thoughts. CBT focuses on challenging the accuracy of dysfunctional 
      thoughts through cognitive restructuring exercises, whereas ACT attempts to foster 
      acceptance of such thoughts through cognitive defusion exercises. Previous research 
      suggests that both techniques reduce the distress associated with negative thoughts, 
      though questions remain regarding the benefit of these techniques above and beyond 
      exposure to feared stimuli. AIMS: In the present study, we conducted a brief 
      experimental intervention to examine the utility of cognitive defusion + in-vivo 
      exposure, cognitive restructuring + in-vivo exposure, and in-vivo exposure alone in 
      reducing the impact of negative thoughts in patients with social anxiety disorder. 
      METHOD: All participants completed a brief public speaking exposure and those in the 
      cognitive conditions received training in the assigned cognitive technique. 
      Participants returned a week later to complete a second exposure task and 
      self-report measures. RESULTS: All three conditions resulted in similar decreases in 
      discomfort related to negative thoughts. ANOVA models failed to find an interaction 
      between change in accuracy or importance and assignment to condition in predicting 
      decreased distress of negative thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results 
      suggest that changes in perceived importance and accuracy of negative thoughts may 
      not be the mechanisms by which cognitive defusion and cognitive restructuring affect 
      distress in the short-term.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Correct prediction of treatment response is a central goal of precision 
      psychiatry. Here, we tested the predictive accuracy of a variety of pre-treatment 
      patient characteristics, including clinical, demographic, molecular genetic, and 
      neuroimaging markers, for treatment response in patients with social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD). METHODS: Forty-seven SAD patients (mean±SD age 33.9 ± 9.4 years, 24 
      women) were randomized and commenced 9 weeks' Internet-delivered cognitive behavior 
      therapy (CBT) combined either with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
      escitalopram (20 mg daily [10 mg first week], SSRI+CBT, n = 24) or placebo 
      (placebo+CBT, n = 23). Treatment responders were defined from the Clinical Global 
      Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I ≤ 2). Before treatment, patients underwent 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Multi-Source Interference Task taxing 
      cognitive interference. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained to separate 
      responders from nonresponders based on pre-treatment neural reactivity in the dorsal 
      anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), amygdala, and occipital cortex, as well as 
      molecular genetic, demographic, and clinical data. SVM models were tested using 
      leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The best model separated treatment 
      responders (n = 24) from nonresponders based on pre-treatment dACC reactivity (83% 
      accuracy, P = 0.001). Responders had greater pre-treatment dACC reactivity than 
      nonresponders especially in the SSRI+CBT group. No other variable was associated 
      with clinical response or added predictive accuracy to the dACC SVM model. 
      LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, especially for genetic analyses. No replication or 
      validation samples were available. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that 
      treatment outcome predictions based on neural cingulate activity, at the individual 
      level, outperform genetic, demographic, and clinical variables for 
      medication-assisted Internet-delivered CBT, supporting the use of neuroimaging in 
      precision psychiatry.

PG  - 339-350
LID - 10.1037/pst0000129 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated whether partner-related attachment characteristics 
      differentially predict premature treatment termination as well as posttreatment and 
      1-year follow-up outcome in patients with social anxiety disorder treated with a 
      manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or short-term psychodynamic therapy 
      (PDT) in the SOPHO-NET (Social Phobia Psychotherapy Network) trial. Participants 
      were 412 patients with social anxiety disorder (57% female) with a mean age of 35.4 
      years (SD = 12.1) who were randomized to either CBT or PDT. Partner-related 
      attachment characteristics were measured using the revised Experiences in Close 
      Relationships Questionnaire (ECR-R) at pretreatment. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety 
      Scale was administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and a 1-year follow-up. To 
      address our research questions, linear regression models were applied. Furthermore, 
      we compared CBT versus PDT patients within ECR-R quartiles. Treatment dropout did 
      not differ between CBT and PDT and was not predicted by pretreatment attachment. In 
      both treatment conditions, there was a trend for higher attachment anxiety to be 
      associated with a more limited reduction in symptoms if controlling for pretreatment 
      Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores. Exploratory analyses showed that patients 
      assigned to the highest quartile of the ECR-R-Avoidance distribution showed more 
      benefit within the CBT condition posttreatment and at follow-up than the PDT 
      condition. Our findings suggest that it may be useful to assess attachment 
      characteristics in patients with social anxiety disorder before psychotherapeutic 
      treatment. Patients characterized by very high pretreatment attachment avoidance 
      (ECR-R-Avoidance >3.87) may specifically benefit more from CBT than from PDT. 
      However, replication studies are needed that also should investigate nonlinear 
      effects of pretreatment attachment. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Group cognitive behavioral therapy modulates the resting-state functional 
      connectivity of amygdala-related network in patients with generalized social anxiety 
      disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amygdala is considered as the core pathogenesis of generalized social 
      anxiety disorder (GSAD). However, it is still unclear whether effective group 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could modulate the function of amygdala-related 
      network. We aimed to examine the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the 
      amygdala before and after group CBT. METHODS: Fifteen patients with GSAD were 
      scanned on a 3T MR system before and after 8 weeks of group CBT. For comparison, 
      nineteen healthy control participants also underwent baseline fMRI scanning. We used 
      bilateral amygdala as seed regions and the rsFC maps of the right and left amygdala 
      were created separately in a voxel-wise way. Clusters survived two-tailed Gaussian 
      Random Field (GRF) correction at p <0.05 (voxel z value >2.3). RESULTS: Compared 
      with baseline, patients with CBT showed significantly decreased connectivity of the 
      left amygdala with the right putamen, the left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex 
      (dmPFC) and the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Especially, the 
      changes of the connectivity between the left amygdala and the dACC positively 
      correlated with changes of the anxiety symptom in patients. Furthermore, in relative 
      to controls, patients showed higher connectivity of left amygdala with dmPFC and 
      dACC at baseline, while normal after CBT. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term group CBT could 
      down-regulate the abnormal higher connectivity of prefrontal-amygdala network, along 
      with clinical improvement. This may provide a potential biomarker to monitor the 
      treatment effect of CBT in GSAD patients.

      study.
PG  - 81
LID - 10.1186/1471-244X-10-81 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common anxiety 
      disorders. The efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been examined but 
      to date its effects on Quality of Life (QoL) have not been appropriately evaluated 
      especially in the long term.The study aimed to examine, in the long term, what 
      aspects of Quality of Life (QoL) changed among social anxiety disorder (SAD) 
      patients treated with group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and what predictors at 
      baseline were associated with QoL. METHODS: Outpatients diagnosed with SAD were 
      enrolled into group CBT, and assessed at follow-ups for up to 12 months in a typical 
      clinical setting. QoL was evaluated using the Short Form 36. Various aspects of SAD 
      symptomatology were also assessed. Each of the QoL domains and scores on 
      symptomatology were quantified and compared with those at baseline. Baseline 
      predictors of QoL outcomes at follow-up were investigated. RESULTS: Fifty-seven 
      outpatients were enrolled into group CBT for SAD, 48 completed the whole program, 
      and 44 and 40 completed assessments at the 3-month and 12-month follow-ups, 
      respectively. All aspects of SAD symptomatology and psychological subscales of the 
      QoL showed statistically significant improvement throughout follow-ups for up to 12 
      months. In terms of social functioning, no statistically significant improvement was 
      observed at either follow-up point except for post-treatment. No consistently 
      significant pre-treatment predictors were observed. CONCLUSIONS: After group CBT, 
      SAD symptomatology and some aspects of QoL improved and this improvement was 
      maintained for up to 12 months, but the social functioning domain did not prove any 
      significant change statistically. Considering the limited effects of CBT on QoL, 
      especially for social functioning, more powerful treatments are needed.

PG  - 142
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-12-142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychodynamic psychotherapy is frequently applied in the treatment of 
      social phobia. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of studies on the transfer of 
      manualized treatments to routine psychodynamic practice. Our study is the first one 
      to examine the effects of additional training in a manualized Short Term 
      Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) procedure on outcome in routine psychotherapy for 
      social phobia. This study is an extension to a large multi-site RCT (N = 512) 
      comparing the efficacy of STPP to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) of Social 
      Phobia. METHODS/DESIGN: The manualized treatment is designed for a time limited 
      approach with 25 individual sessions of STPP over 6 months. Private practitioners 
      will be randomized to training in manualized STPP vs. treatment as usual without a 
      specific training (control condition). We plan to enrol a total of 105 patients (84 
      completers). Assessments will be conducted before treatment starts, after 8 and 15 
      weeks, after 25 treatment sessions, at the end of treatment, 6 months and 12 months 
      after termination of treatment. The primary outcome measure is the Liebowitz Social 
      Anxiety Scale. Remission from social phobia is defined scoring with 30 or less 
      points on this scale. DISCUSSION: We will investigate how the treatment can be 
      transferred from a controlled trial into the less structured setting of routine 
      clinical care. This question represents Phase IV of psychotherapy research. It 
      combines the benefits of randomized controlled and naturalistic research. The study 
      is genuinely designed to promote faster and more widespread dissemination of 
      effective interventions. It will answer the questions whether manualized STPP can be 
      implemented into routine outpatient care, whether the new methods improve treatment 
      courses and outcomes and whether treatment effects reached in routine 
      psychotherapeutic treatments are comparable to those of the controlled, strictly 
      manualized treatment of the main study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials

AB  - CONTEXT: Current behavioral measures poorly predict treatment outcome in social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine 
      neuroimaging-based treatment prediction in SAD. OBJECTIVE: To measure brain 
      activation in patients with SAD as a biomarker to predict subsequent response to 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). DESIGN: Functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) data were collected prior to CBT intervention. Changes in clinical status 
      were regressed on brain responses and tested for selectivity for social stimuli. 
      SETTING: Patients were treated with protocol-based CBT at anxiety disorder programs 
      at Boston University or Massachusetts General Hospital and underwent neuroimaging 
      data collection at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. PATIENTS: Thirty-nine 
      medication-free patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for the generalized subtype of SAD. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Brain responses to angry vs neutral faces or emotional vs neutral 
      scenes were examined with fMRI prior to initiation of CBT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Whole-brain regression analyses with differential fMRI responses for angry vs 
      neutral faces and changes in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale score as the treatment 
      outcome measure. RESULTS: Pretreatment responses significantly predicted subsequent 
      treatment outcome of patients selectively for social stimuli and particularly in 
      regions of higher-order visual cortex. Combining the brain measures with information 
      on clinical severity accounted for more than 40% of the variance in treatment 
      response and substantially exceeded predictions based on clinical measures at 
      baseline. Prediction success was unaffected by testing for potential confounding 
      factors such as depression severity at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest 
      that brain imaging can provide biomarkers that substantially improve predictions for 
      the success of cognitive behavioral interventions and more generally suggest that 
      such biomarkers may offer evidence-based, personalized medicine approaches for 
      optimally selecting among treatment options for a patient.

LID - 10.1016/j.jaac.2015.03.018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Genes for Treatment study is an international, multisite 
      collaboration exploring the role of genetic, demographic, and clinical predictors in 
      response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in pediatric anxiety disorders. The 
      current article, the first from the study, examined demographic and clinical 
      predictors of response to CBT. We hypothesized that the child's gender, type of 
      anxiety disorder, initial severity and comorbidity, and parents' psychopathology 
      would significantly predict outcome. METHOD: A sample of 1,519 children 5 to 18 
      years of age with a primary anxiety diagnosis received CBT across 11 sites. Outcome 
      was defined as response (change in diagnostic severity) and remission (absence of 
      the primary diagnosis) at each time point (posttreatment, 3-, 6-, and/or 12-month 
      follow-up) and analyzed using linear and logistic mixed models. Separate analyses 
      were conducted using data from posttreatment and follow-up assessments to explore 
      the relative importance of predictors at these time points. RESULTS: Individuals 
      with social anxiety disorder (SoAD) had significantly poorer outcomes (poorer 
      response and lower rates of remission) than those with generalized anxiety disorder 
      (GAD). Although individuals with specific phobia (SP) also had poorer outcomes than 
      those with GAD at posttreatment, these differences were not maintained at follow-up. 
      Both comorbid mood and externalizing disorders significantly predicted poorer 
      outcomes at posttreatment and follow-up, whereas self-reported parental 
      psychopathology had little effect on posttreatment outcomes but significantly 
      predicted response (although not remission) at follow-up. CONCLUSION: SoAD, 
      nonanxiety comorbidity, and parental psychopathology were associated with poorer 
      outcomes after CBT. The results highlight the need for enhanced treatments for 
      children at risk for poorer outcomes.

LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32650 [doi]
AB  - Differential DNA methylation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis related gene 
      FKBP5 has recently been shown to be associated with varying response to 
      environmental influences and may play a role in how well people respond to 
      psychological treatments. Participants (n = 111) received exposure-based cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) for agoraphobia with or without panic disorder, or 
      specific phobias. Percentage DNA methylation levels were measured for the promoter 
      region and intron 7 of FKBP5. The association between percentage reduction in 
      clinical severity and change in DNA methylation was tested using linear mixed 
      models. The effect of genotype (rs1360780) was tested by the inclusion of an 
      interaction term. The association between change in DNA methylation and FKBP5 
      expression was examined. Change in percentage DNA methylation at one CpG site of 
      intron 7 was associated with percentage reduction in severity (β = -4.26, p = 3.90 × 
      10(-4) ), where a decrease in DNA methylation was associated with greater response 
      to therapy. An interaction was detected between rs1360780 and changes in DNA 
      methylation in the promoter region of FKBP5 on treatment outcome (p = .045) but did 
      not survive correction for multiple testing. Changes in DNA methylation were not 
      associated with FKBP5 expression. Decreasing DNA methylation at one CpG site of 
      intron 7 of FKBP5 was strongly associated with decreasing anxiety severity following 
      exposure-based CBT. In addition, there was suggestive evidence that allele-specific 
      methylation at the promoter region may also be associated with treatment response. 
      The results of this study add to the growing literature demonstrating the role of 
      biological processes such as DNA methylation in response to environmental 
      influences.

TI  - Brain connectomics predict response to treatment in social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 680-5
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.109 [doi]
AB  - We asked whether brain connectomics can predict response to treatment for a 
      neuropsychiatric disorder better than conventional clinical measures. Pre-treatment 
      resting-state brain functional connectivity and diffusion-weighted structural 
      connectivity were measured in 38 patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) to 
      predict subsequent treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We used 
      a priori bilateral anatomical amygdala seed-driven resting connectivity and 
      probabilistic tractography of the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus together 
      with a data-driven multivoxel pattern analysis of whole-brain resting-state 
      connectivity before treatment to predict improvement in social anxiety after CBT. 
      Each connectomic measure improved the prediction of individuals' treatment outcomes 
      significantly better than a clinical measure of initial severity, and combining the 
      multimodal connectomics yielded a fivefold improvement in predicting treatment 
      response. Generalization of the findings was supported by leave-one-out 
      cross-validation. After dividing patients into better or worse responders, logistic 
      regression of connectomic predictors and initial severity combined with 
      leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a categorical prediction of clinical 
      improvement with 81% accuracy, 84% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Connectomics of 
      the human brain, measured by widely available imaging methods, may provide 
      brain-based biomarkers (neuromarkers) supporting precision medicine that better 
      guide patients with neuropsychiatric diseases to optimal available treatments, and 
      thus translate basic neuroimaging into medical practice.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder at the turn of the millennium.
PG  - 783-803
AB  - Over the past 21 years since the birth of SP into the diagnostic nomenclature, there 
      have been significant gains in knowledge about effective pharmacologic and 
      psychotherapeutic treatments. The SSRIs have emerged as the first-line pharmacologic 
      treatment, although good evidence shows efficacy of benzodiazepines; MAOIs; and 
      anticonvulsant agents, such as gabapentin and pregabalin. There is also emerging 
      evidence about the efficacy of the novel antidepressant venlafaxine and also 
      optimism for the potential utility of nefazodone and possibly bupropion. However, 
      there are many areas requiring further investigation. There has been a great deal of 
      excitement about the publication of the RUPP Anxiety Study, demonstrating efficacy 
      for fluvoxamine in socially phobic youth. Given that SP starts in childhood and 
      adolescence, more data are needed to support the use of pharmacotherapy in this age 
      group because early intervention may prevent the sequelae of chronic SP. There needs 
      to be more investigation into what is required for social phobic individuals who 
      obtain a good response to pharmacotherapy to move into full-remission status. 
      Additional research is needed regarding the evaluation of the comparative efficacy 
      of different drug classes and to develop an improved capability of predicting 
      treatment response to a particular type of treatment. In addition, more research is 
      needed regarding treatment resistance. In most of the anxiety disorders that have 
      been studied, combining CBT with psychopharmacologic treatment has shown little 
      advantage over either treatment alone. These findings may be due to methodologic 
      problems. Research is needed on how to sequence treatments to maximize the benefits 
      of combining the two types of effective treatments together. Finally, many 
      clinicians are seeing an emerging trend of individuals who have had untreated SP all 
      of their lives and are now presenting for treatment in their "golden years." The 
      current established treatments need to be evaluated further in this geriatric 
      population.

TI  - Efficacy of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy versus monotherapy in the 
      treatment of anxiety disorders.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - Anxiety disorders in the United States are prevalent, widespread, and disabling. 
      These illnesses may account for almost one third of the $148 billion total mental 
      health bill each year. Pharmacologic options include tricyclic antidepressants, 
      monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anxiolytics. Psychological treatments 
      include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive therapy, exposure, and ritual 
      prevention therapies. Despite insufficient evidence, many experts recommend combined 
      treatment, generally medication with CBT. A literature review was conducted to 
      examine studies with random assignment, adequate methods and sample sizes, blind 
      assessments, sufficient dosages and durations of treatment, and satisfactory 
      reporting of data, to determine whether combined treatment was superior to 
      monotherapy. Twenty-six randomized clinical trials were identified; nine met review 
      criteria. A review of relevant studies could not confirm the superiority of combined 
      treatment over monotherapy. In one of four studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
      combined treatment produced better results than monotherapy. There was no evidence 
      of superiority for combined therapy over monotherapy for the treatment of social 
      phobia or generalized anxiety disorder. There were no studies that met review 
      criteria for either specific phobia or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). With 
      panic disorder, there was evidence that combined treatment might actually lead to 
      worse outcome. Combined treatment is commonly recommended, but empirical support is 
      limited. More research is needed. There are few well-designed studies, and little 
      data regarding PTSD and specific phobias.

PG  - 1
LID - 10.1186/1753-2000-4-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the design, methods, and rationale of the Child/Adolescent 
      Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), a recently completed federally-funded, multi-site, 
      randomized placebo-controlled trial that examined the relative efficacy of 
      cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), sertraline (SRT), and their combination (COMB) 
      against pill placebo (PBO) for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder (SAD), 
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social phobia (SoP) in children and 
      adolescents. METHODS: Following a brief review of the acute outcomes of the CAMS 
      trial, as well as the psychosocial and pharmacologic treatment literature for 
      pediatric anxiety disorders, the design and methods of the CAMS trial are described. 
      RESULTS: CAMS was a six-year, six-site, randomized controlled trial. Four hundred 
      eighty-eight (N = 488) children and adolescents (ages 7-17 years) with DSM-IV-TR 
      diagnoses of SAD, GAD, or SoP were randomly assigned to one of four treatment 
      conditions: CBT, SRT, COMB, or PBO. Assessments of anxiety symptoms, safety, and 
      functional outcomes, as well as putative mediators and moderators of treatment 
      response were completed in a multi-measure, multi-informant fashion. Manual-based 
      therapies, trained clinicians and independent evaluators were used to ensure 
      treatment and assessment fidelity. A multi-layered administrative structure with 
      representation from all sites facilitated cross-site coordination of the entire 
      trial, study protocols and quality assurance. CONCLUSIONS: CAMS offers a model for 
      clinical trials methods applicable to psychosocial and psychopharmacological 
      comparative treatment trials by using state-of-the-art methods and rigorous 
      cross-site quality controls. CAMS also provided a large-scale examination of the 
      relative and combined efficacy and safety of the best evidenced-based psychosocial 
      (CBT) and pharmacologic (SSRI) treatments to date for the most commonly occurring 
      pediatric anxiety disorders. Primary and secondary results of CAMS will hold 
      important implications for informing practice-relevant decisions regarding the 
      initial treatment of youth with anxiety disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Effects of Home-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Depression on 
      Anxiety Symptoms among Rural, Ethnically Diverse Older Adults.
PG  - 181-190
LID - 10.1080/07317115.2017.1288670 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the effects of home-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) for depression on anxiety symptoms in an ethnically diverse, low resource, and 
      medically frail sample of rural, older adults. METHOD: This was a secondary analysis 
      of a randomized clincial trial with 134 rural-dwelling adults 65 years and older 
      with decreased quality of life and elevated psychological symptomatology. Anxiety 
      symptoms were assessed with the anxiety and phobic anxiety subscales of the Symptom 
      Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). RESULTS: Compared to a minimal support control 
      condition, CBT for depression resulted in significantly greater improvements in 
      symptoms of anxiety and phobic anxiety from pre-treatment to post-treatment. 
      CONCLUSION: Home-delivered CBT for depression can be an effective treatment for 
      anxiety in a hard-to-reach older populations. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Additional 
      research should explore integrated anxiety and depression protocols and other 
      treatment modalities, including bibliotherapy or telehealth models of CBT, to reduce 
      costs associated with its in home delivery. Flexibility in administration and 
      adaptations to the CBT protocol may be necessary for use with vulnerable, rural 
      older adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine optimal Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) percent 
      reduction and raw score cut-offs for predicting treatment response and remission 
      among children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. METHOD: Data were from a 
      subset of youth (N = 438; 7-17 years of age) who participated in the 
      Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), a multi-site, randomized 
      controlled trial that examined the relative efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT; Coping Cat), medication (sertraline [SRT]), their combination, and pill 
      placebo for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety 
      disorder, and social phobia. The clinician-rated PARS was administered pre- and 
      posttreatment (delivered over 12 weeks). Quality receiver operating characteristic 
      methods assessed the performance of various PARS percent reductions and absolute 
      cut-off scores in predicting treatment response and remission, as determined by 
      posttreatment ratings on the Clinical Global Impression scales and the Anxiety 
      Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV. Corresponding change in impairment was 
      evaluated using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale. RESULTS: Reductions of 35% and 50% 
      on the six-item PARS optimally predicted treatment response and remission, 
      respectively. Post-treatment PARS raw scores of 8 to 10 optimally predicted 
      remission. Anxiety improved as a function of PARS-defined treatment response and 
      remission. CONCLUSIONS: Results serve as guidelines for operationalizing treatment 
      response and remission in future research and in making cross-study comparisons. 
      These guidelines can facilitate translation of research findings into clinical 
      practice.

AB  - Excessive attention toward aversive information may be a core mechanism underlying 
      emotional disorders, but little is known about whether this is predictive of 
      response to treatments. We evaluated whether enhanced attention toward aversive 
      stimuli, as indexed by an event-related potential component, the late positive 
      potential (LPP), would predict response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in 
      patients with social anxiety disorder and/or major depressive disorder. Thirty-two 
      patients receiving 12 weeks of CBT responded to briefly-presented pairs of aversive 
      and neutral pictures that served as targets or distracters while 
      electroencephaolography was recorded. Patients with larger pre-treatment LPPs to 
      aversive relative to neutral distracters (when targets were aversive) were more 
      likely to respond to CBT, and demonstrated larger reductions in symptoms of 
      depression and anxiety following treatment. Increased attention toward irrelevant 
      aversive stimuli may signal attenuated top-down control, so treatments like CBT that 
      improve this control could be beneficial for these individuals.

TI  - School-based interventions for anxious children.
PG  - 1118-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of three school-based interventions for 
      anxious children: group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for children, group CBT 
      for children plus parent training group, and no-treatment control. METHOD: Students 
      (7-11 years old) in three elementary schools (N = 453) were screened using the 
      Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and teacher nomination. Subsequently, 
      101 identified children and their parents completed the Anxiety Disorders Interview 
      Schedule for DSM-IV, Child Version. Children with features or DSM-IV diagnoses of 
      separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia (n = 
      61) were randomized by school to one of three conditions. Active treatments were 
      nine weekly sessions of either group CBT or group CBT plus concurrent parent 
      training. RESULTS: Clinician-report, child-report, and parent-report measures of 
      child anxiety demonstrated significant benefits of CBT treatments over the 
      no-treatment control group. Effect size was 0.58 for change in composite clinician 
      severity rating, the primary outcome measure, favoring collapsed CBT conditions 
      compared with control. In addition, several instruments showed significantly greater 
      improvement in child anxiety for group CBT plus parent training over group CBT 
      alone. CONCLUSIONS: Both active CBT treatments were more effective than the 
      no-treatment control condition in decreasing child anxiety symptoms and associated 
      impairment. When parent training was combined with child group CBT, there were some 
      additional benefits for the children.

TI  - Neurobiology of anxiety disorders and implications for treatment.
PG  - 941-9
AB  - The neurobiology of the anxiety disorders, which include panic disorder, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and specific phobias, among others, has been 
      clarified by advances in the field of classical or Pavlovian conditioning, and in 
      our understanding of basic mechanisms of memory and learning. Fear conditioning 
      occurs when a neutral conditioned stimulus (such as a tone) is paired with an 
      aversive, or unconditioned stimulus (such as a footshock), and then in the absence 
      of the unconditioned stimulus, causes a conditioned fear response. Preclinical 
      studies have shown that the amygdala plays a key role in fear circuitry, and that 
      abnormalities in amygdala pathways can affect the acquisition and expression of fear 
      conditioning. Drugs such as glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, and 
      blockers of voltage-gated calcium channels, in the amygdala, may block these 
      effects. There is also preliminary evidence for the use of centrally acting 
      beta-adrenergic antagonists, like propranolol, to inhibit consolidation of traumatic 
      memories in PTSD. Finally, fear extinction, which entails new learning of fear 
      inhibition, is central to the mechanism of effective anti-anxiety treatments. 
      Several pharmacological manipulations, such as D-cycloserine, a partial NMDA 
      agonist, have been found to facilitate extinction. Combining these medication 
      approaches with psychotherapies that promote extinction, such as cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT), may offer patients with anxiety disorders a rapid and 
      robust treatment with good durability of effect.

TI  - Adequacy of treatment received by primary care patients with anxiety disorders.
PG  - 443-50
LID - 10.1002/da.22209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the adequacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy received 
      by primary care patients with anxiety disorders over up to 5 years of follow-up. 
      METHOD: Five hundred thirty-four primary care patients at 15 US sites, who screened 
      positive for anxiety symptoms, were assessed for anxiety disorders. Those meeting 
      anxiety disorder criteria were offered participation and interviewed again at six 
      and 12 months postintake, and yearly thereafter for up to 5 years. We utilized 
      existing definitions of appropriate pharmacotherapy and created definitions of 
      potentially adequate psychotherapy/cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). RESULTS: At 
      intake, of 534 primary care participants with anxiety disorders, 19% reported 
      receiving appropriate pharmacotherapy and 14% potentially adequate CBT. Overall, 28% 
      of participants reported receiving potentially adequate anxiety treatment, whether 
      pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or both. Over up to five years of follow-up, 
      appropriate pharmacotherapy was received by 60% and potentially adequate CBT by 36% 
      of the sample. Examined together, 69% of participants received any potentially 
      adequate treatment during the follow-up period. Over the course of follow-up, 
      primary care patients with MDD, panic disorder with agoraphobia, and with 
      medicaid/medicare were more likely to receive appropriate anxiety treatment. Ethnic 
      minority members were less likely to receive potentially adequate care. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Potentially adequate anxiety treatment was rarely received by primary care patients 
      with anxiety disorders at intake. Encouragingly, rates improved over the course of 
      the study. However, potentially adequate CBT remained much less utilized than 
      pharmacotherapy and racial-ethnic minority members were less likely to received 
      care, suggesting much room for improved dissemination of quality treatment.

AB  - In social anxiety disorder (SAD) co-morbid depressive symptoms as well as avoidance 
      behaviors have been shown to predict insufficient treatment response. It is likely 
      that subgroups of individuals with different profiles of risk factors for poor 
      treatment response exist. This study aimed to identify subgroups of social avoidance 
      and depressive symptoms in a clinical sample (N = 167) with SAD before and after 
      guided internet-delivered CBT, and to compare these groups on diagnostic status and 
      social anxiety. We further examined individual movement between subgroups over time. 
      Using cluster analysis we identified four subgroups, including a high-problem 
      cluster at both time-points. Individuals in this cluster showed less remission after 
      treatment, exhibited higher levels of social anxiety at both assessments, and 
      typically remained in the high-problem cluster after treatment. Thus, in individuals 
      with SAD, high levels of social avoidance and depressive symptoms constitute a risk 
      profile for poor treatment response.

TI  - Are children with social anxiety disorder more likely than children with other 
      anxiety disorders to anticipate poor social performance and reflect negatively on 
      their performance?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cognitive theory of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggests that 
      adults with SAD have a tendency to anticipate poor social performance and reflect 
      negatively on their performance following a social event. While a number of studies 
      with socially anxious adults have supported the role of poor performance 
      anticipation and post-event rumination in SAD, to date, only a few studies have 
      addressed whether this also applies to children with SAD. METHODS: Children (7-12 
      years) diagnosed with SAD (n = 40), other anxious children (n = 40) and non-anxious 
      children (n = 34) were exposed to a social stressor speech task and their pre- and 
      post-performance appraisals assessed, taking into account objective performance 
      ratings. RESULTS: Although observers rated some aspects of performance as 
      significantly worse among children with SAD than children with other anxiety 
      disorders, children with SAD were not more likely than their anxious or non-anxious 
      peers to show a general bias in pre- or post-performance appraisals. Furthermore, 
      children with SAD were just as likely as their anxious and non-anxious peers to 
      recognize good performance but were more critical of themselves when their 
      performance was poor. LIMITATIONS: The speech task did not involve a same-age peer. 
      Participants were relatively affluent group of predominantly non-minority status. 
      Specificity for SAD in relation to other anxiety disorders remains unclear. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on counteracting pre- and post-event social performance 
      appraisals may potentially be inappropriate for childhood SAD. Children with SAD 
      might benefit from interventions that focus on helping them to become less critical 
      of themselves after social interactions have not gone well.

TI  - The treatment of social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 883-908
AB  - We review the available treatments for social anxiety disorder, focusing primarily 
      on psychotherapeutic interventions for adults, but also giving briefer summaries of 
      pharmacological treatments and treatments for children and adolescents. The most 
      well-researched psychosocial treatments for social anxiety disorder are 
      cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs), and meta-analyses indicate that all forms of 
      CBT appear likely to provide some benefit for adults. In addition, there are several 
      pharmacological treatments with demonstrated efficacy, and cognitive-behavioral 
      interventions have some demonstrated efficacy for children and adolescents. We 
      outline a number of concerns regarding this literature, including the questions of 
      what influences treatment response and what role combinations of CBT and medication 
      might have. Clearly, although a number of treatments appear well-established in 
      regard to their effects on social anxiety disorder, a number of opportunities for 
      future research remain, including the search for predictors of who will benefit from 
      which treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether the Unified Protocol (UP), a 
      transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy for emotional disorders (i.e., anxiety, 
      mood, and related disorders), is efficacious in the treatment of co-occurring 
      emotional disorders compared to established single disorder protocols (SDPs) that 
      target specific disorders (e.g., panic disorder). METHOD: Participants included 179 
      adults seeking outpatient psychotherapy. Participant age ranged from 18 to 66 years, 
      with an average of 30.66 years (SD = 10.77). The sample was 55% female and mostly 
      Caucasian (83%). Diagnostic assessments were completed with the Anxiety Disorder 
      Interview Schedule (ADIS), and disorder-specific, clinician-rated measures for the 
      comorbid diagnoses of interest. RESULTS: In both treatment conditions, participants' 
      mean number of diagnoses dropped significantly from baseline to posttreatment, and 
      baseline to 12-month follow-up. Additionally, large effects were observed for 
      changes in comorbid generalized anxiety (ES(SG): UP = -1.72; SDP = -1.98), social 
      anxiety (ES(SG): UP = -1.33, -0.86; SDP = -1.60, -1.54), and depression (ES(SG): 
      UP = -0.83; SDP = -0.84). Significant differences were not observed in between-group 
      comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that both the UP and SDPs are efficacious 
      in reducing symptoms of comorbid emotional disorders. The clinical, practical, and 
      cost-effective advantages of transdiagnostic CBT are discussed.

      study.
PG  - 543-68
AB  - Despite the demonstrated efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD), many individuals do not respond to treatment or demonstrate 
      residual symptoms and impairment posttreatment. Preliminary evidence indicates that 
      acceptance-based approaches (e.g., acceptance and commitment therapy; ACT) can be 
      helpful for a variety of disorders and emphasize exposure-based strategies and 
      processes. Nineteen individuals diagnosed with SAD participated in a 12-week program 
      integrating exposure therapy and ACT. Results revealed no changes across a 4-week 
      baseline control period. From pretreatment to follow-up, significant improvements 
      occurred in social anxiety symptoms and quality of life, yielding large effect size 
      gains. Significant changes also were found in ACT-consistent process measures, and 
      earlier changes in experiential avoidance predicted later changes in symptom 
      severity. Results suggest the acceptability and potential efficacy of ACT for SAD 
      and highlight the need for future research examining both the efficacy and 
      mechanisms of change of acceptance-based programs for SAD.

TI  - Cerebellar Neural Circuits Involving Executive Control Network Predict Response to 
      Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Social Anxiety Disorder.
PG  - 673-682

AB  - Some intrinsic connectivity networks including the default mode network (DMN) and 
      executive control network (ECN) may underlie social anxiety disorder (SAD). Although 
      the cerebellum has been implicated in the pathophysiology of SAD and several 
      networks relevant to higher-order cognition, it remains unknown whether cerebellar 
      areas involved in DMN and ECN exhibit altered resting-state functional connectivity 
      (rsFC) with cortical networks in SAD. Forty-six patients with SAD and 64 healthy 
      controls (HC) were included and submitted to the baseline resting-state functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seventeen SAD patients who completed 
      post-treatment clinical assessments were included after group cognitive behavior 
      therapy (CBT). RsFC of three cerebellar subregions in both groups was assessed 
      respectively in a voxel-wise way, and these rsFC maps were compared by two-sample t 
      tests between groups. Whole-brain voxel-wise regression was performed to examine 
      whether cerebellar connectivity networks can predict response to CBT. Lower rsFC 
      circuits of cerebellar subregions compared with HC at baseline (p < 0.05, corrected 
      by false discovery rate) were revealed. The left Crus I rsFC with dorsal medial 
      prefrontal cortex was negatively correlated with symptom severity. The clinical 
      assessments in SAD patients were significantly decreased after CBT. Higher 
      pretreatment cerebellar rsFC with angular gyrus and dorsal lateral frontal cortex 
      corresponded with greater symptom improvement following CBT. Cerebellar rsFC 
      circuits involving DMN and ECN are possible neuropathologic mechanisms of SAD. 
      Stronger pretreatment cerebellar rsFC circuits involving ECN suggest potential 
      neural markers to predict CBT response.

TI  - Predictors and moderators of treatment response in childhood anxiety disorders: 
      results from the CAMS trial.
PG  - 212-24
LID - 10.1037/a0035458 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes 
      among 488 youths ages 7-17 years (50% female; 74% ≤ 12 years) meeting Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; American Psychiatric 
      Association, 2000) criteria for diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, social 
      phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder who were randomly assigned to receive either 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or 
      medication management with pill placebo (PBO) in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety 
      Multimodal Study (CAMS). METHOD: Six classes of predictor and moderator variables 
      (22 variables) were identified from the literature and examined using continuous 
      (Pediatric Anxiety Ratings Scale; PARS) and categorical (Clinical Global Impression 
      Scale-Improvement; CGI-I) outcome measures. RESULTS: Three baseline variables 
      predicted better outcomes (independent of treatment condition) on the PARS, 
      including low anxiety severity (as measured by parents and independent evaluators) 
      and caregiver strain. No baseline variables were found to predict Week 12 responder 
      status (CGI-I). Participants' principal diagnosis moderated treatment outcomes but 
      only on the PARS. No baseline variables were found to moderate treatment outcomes on 
      Week 12 responder status (CGI-I). DISCUSSION: Overall, anxious children responded 
      favorably to CAMS treatments. However, having more severe and impairing anxiety, 
      greater caregiver strain, and a principal diagnosis of social phobia were associated 
      with less favorable outcomes. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - Manualized Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder: A Case Study.
PG  - 35-47
AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is one of the most 
      common anxiety disorders and has been shown to be effectively treated using 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Recently, a manualized CBT treatment for SAD has 
      been developed (Hope, Heimberg, & Turk, 2006), with research demonstrating superior 
      treatment outcomes with CBT relative to alternatives (e.g., psychotropic 
      medication). The current case study of Henry, a 26-year old Caucasian male with SAD, 
      implemented this manualized CBT for SAD. Treatment consisted of 15 individual 
      sessions, with follow-ups occurring 2 and 8 months post-treatment. Henry showed 
      marked reductions in SAD symptoms throughout the course of treatment, resulting in 
      complete remission of SAD at the end of formal treatment. His SAD continued to be in 
      remission at the 2-and 8-month follow-up sessions. This case study demonstrates the 
      usefulness of a manualized, individual CBT treatment for SAD.

TI  - Mental imagery as an emotional amplifier: application to bipolar disorder.
PG  - 1251-8
LID - 10.1016/j.brat.2008.09.005 [doi]
AB  - Cognitions in the form of mental images have a more powerful impact on emotion than 
      their verbal counterparts. This review synthesizes the cognitive science of imagery 
      and emotion with transdiagnostic clinical research, yielding novel predictions for 
      the basis of emotional volatility in bipolar disorder. Anxiety is extremely common 
      in patients with bipolar disorder and is associated with increased dysfunction and 
      suicidality, yet it is poorly understood and rarely treated. Mental imagery is a 
      neglected aspect of bipolar anxiety although in anxiety disorders such as 
      posttraumatic stress disorder and social phobia focusing on imagery has been crucial 
      for the development of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). In this review we present a 
      cognitive model of imagery and emotion applied to bipolar disorder. Within this 
      model mental imagery amplifies emotion, drawing on Clark's cyclical panic model 
      [(1986). A cognitive approach to panic. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 24, 
      461-470]. We (1) emphasise imagery's amplification of anxiety (cycle one); (2) 
      suggest that imagery amplifies the defining (hypo-) mania of bipolar disorder (cycle 
      two), whereby the overly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to mood 
      elevation (escalated by imagery), increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action 
      likelihood (all strengthened by imagery). Imagery suggests a unifying explanation 
      for key unexplained features of bipolar disorder: ubiquitous anxiety, mood 
      instability and creativity. Introducing imagery has novel implications for bipolar 
      treatment innovation--an area where CBT improvements are much-needed.

TI  - Does occasional cannabis use impact anxiety and depression treatment outcomes?: 
      Results from a randomized effectiveness trial.
PG  - 392-8
AB  - This study investigated the extent to which occasional cannabis use moderated 
      anxiety and depression outcomes in the Collaborative Care for Anxiety and Panic 
      (CCAP) study, a combined cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy 
      randomized effectiveness trial. Participants were 232 adults from six 
      university-based primary care outpatient clinics in three West Coast cities 
      randomized to receive either the CCAP intervention or the usual care condition. 
      Results showed significant (P<.01) evidence of an interaction between treatment 
      group (CCAP vs. usual care) and cannabis use status (monthly vs. less than monthly) 
      for depressive symptoms, but not for panic disorder or social phobia symptoms (all 
      P>.05). Monthly cannabis users' depressive symptoms improved in the CCAP 
      intervention just as much as those who used cannabis less than monthly, whereas 
      monthly users receiving usual care had significantly more depressive symptoms than 
      those using less than monthly. A combined CBT and medication treatment intervention 
      may be a promising approach for the treatment of depression among occasional 
      cannabis users.

      children.
PG  - 835-48
AB  - This study examines relations between family functioning, parenting stress, parental 
      psychopathology, and treatment outcome. Participants included 61 children (ages 7-11 
      years) with features or diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, generalized 
      anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia. Treatment conditions included group 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and no-treatment control. Higher family cohesion 
      at baseline was associated with significantly greater decreases in child anxiety at 
      posttreatment for participants who received CBT, while no association was found for 
      the no-treatment control participants. Parenting stress and parental psychopathology 
      were not associated with treatment outcome for either condition. Post hoc analyses 
      examining relations between family cohesion, parenting stress, and parental 
      psychopathology showed that parents from families low in cohesion reported 
      significantly higher levels of parenting stress and psychopathology compared to 
      parents from families high in cohesion. These results will facilitate development 
      and implementation of effective interventions with anxious children.

AB  - Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with aberrant anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC) response to threat distractors. Perceptual load has been 
      shown to modulate ACC activity such that under high load, when demands on processing 
      capacity is restricted, individuals with gSAD exhibit compensatory activation to 
      threat distractors yet under low load, there is evidence of reduced activation. It 
      is not known if neural predictors of response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 
      based on such emotional conflict resolution, interact with demands on controlled 
      processes. Prior to CBT, 32 patients with gSAD completed an fMRI task involving a 
      target letter in a string of identical targets (low perceptual load) or a target 
      letter in a mixed letter string (high perceptual load) superimposed on fearful, 
      angry and neutral face distractors. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses revealed better 
      CBT outcome was predicted by more frontopartial activity that included dorsal ACC 
      (dACC) and insula to threat (vs neutral) distractors during high, but not low, 
      perceptual load. Psychophysiological interaction analysis with dACC as the seed 
      region revealed less connectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to threat 
      distractors during high load. Results indicate patients with less regulatory 
      capability when demands on higher-order control are great may benefit more from CBT.

      behavioral group therapy.
PG  - 119-28
LID - 10.1007/s40211-013-0065-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anorexic girls have difficulties in handling their emotions. We examined 
      emotional problems of adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa (AN) during the course 
      of cognitive behavioral group therapy (G-CBT). METHODS: Overall, 29 girls with AN 
      (age 13-17 years) participated in four groups of manual based G-CBT. We assessed the 
      body mass index (BMI), eating behavior psychopathology, emotions, depression, 
      hedonistic activities, self-care and-efficacy, social phobia, sense of coherence 
      (SOC), and alexithymia before, during and up to 1 year after therapy. RESULTS: Out 
      of 29, 16 (55 %, intent to treat, or 76 %, per protocol) girls were successfully 
      treated, 5 (17 or 24 %) had a "poor outcome", and 8 (28 %) dropped out. BMI, eating 
      behavior, mood, social anxiety, self-care, and self-efficacy persistently improved. 
      Anorexic girls had multiple emotional deficits, low self-confidence, and exaggerated 
      needs of control and of being accepted. Emotional deficits were resistant to change. 
      Hedonistic activities, social skills, and recovery from depression were positive, 
      comorbid disorders and parental psychopathology negative prognostic factors.

TI  - Disturbed circadian core body temperature rhythm and sleep disturbance in school 
      refusal children and adolescents.
PG  - 810-3
AB  - We examined the circadian rhythm of core body temperature (CBT) in 22 school refusal 
      patients, ages between 12 and 18 years, who did not have any physical or psychiatric 
      disorders, but had indefinite complaints, and were suspected to have a circadian 
      rhythm disturbance. To obtain normal data for analysis, CBT in 9 healthy age-matched 
      school attendants who did not have any sleep, psychiatric, or medical disturbance 
      were monitored. Circadian variation of CBT in school refusal patients did not 
      present a clear rhythm, and appearance time of their lowest CBT was markedly delayed 
      compared to healthy subjects. Amplitude of circadian CBT changes, fitted to a 
      cosinor curve by the least square method, was significantly smaller in school 
      refusals than in healthy subjects. These findings suggest that in school refusal 
      patients who do not have physical and psychiatric disorders, clinical psychosomatic 
      symptoms (e.g., fatigue and memory disturbance) and school refusal could be closely 
      related to the desynchronization of their biorhythms, particularly the circadian 
      rhythm of body temperature and sleep-wake rhythm.

AB  - The fear of painful procedures is at an increased incidence within the pediatric 
      population. This can be an extremely challenging obstacle in dermatology where 
      injections, blood draws, and cryotherapy are often required during the care of 
      patients. Psychologic techniques based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be 
      implemented leading up to and while performing these procedures to help reduce 
      patient anxiety.

TI  - Trajectories of change in anxiety severity and impairment during and after treatment 
      with evidence-based treatment for multiple anxiety disorders in primary care.
PG  - 1099-106
LID - 10.1002/da.22149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) is a model for 
      delivering evidence-based treatment for anxiety disorders in primary care. Compared 
      to usual care, CALM produced greater improvement in anxiety symptoms. However, mean 
      estimates can obscure heterogeneity in treatment response. This study aimed to 
      identify (1) clusters of participants with similar patterns of change in anxiety 
      severity and impairment (trajectory groups); and (2) characteristics that predict 
      trajectory group membership. METHODS: The CALM randomized controlled effectiveness 
      trial was conducted in 17 primary care clinics in four US cities in 2006-2009. 1,004 
      English- or Spanish-speaking patients age 18-75 with panic, generalized anxiety, 
      social anxiety, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder participated. The Overall 
      Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale was administered repeatedly to 482 
      participants randomized to CALM treatment. Group-based trajectory modeling was 
      applied to identify trajectory groups and multinomial logit to predict trajectory 
      group membership. RESULTS: Two predicted trajectories, representing about two-thirds 
      of participants, were below the cut-off for clinically significant anxiety a couple 
      of months after treatment initiation. The predicted trajectory for the majority of 
      remaining participants was below the cut-off by 9 months. A small group of 
      participants did not show consistent improvement. Being sicker at baseline, not 
      working, and reporting less social support were associated with less favorable 
      trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity in patient response to anxiety 
      treatment. Adverse circumstances appear to hamper treatment response. To what extent 
      anxiety symptoms improve insufficiently because adverse patient circumstances 
      contribute to suboptimal treatment delivery, suboptimal treatment adherence, or 
      suboptimal treatment response requires further investigation.

TI  - Anxiety disorders: treatable regardless of the severity of comorbid alcohol 
      dependence.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - AIMS: Clinical and epidemiological research has shown that comorbidity is the rule 
      rather than exception in the case of psychiatric disorders. Cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) has been clearly demonstrated to be effective in treating anxiety and 
      avoidance symptoms in patient samples of social phobia and agoraphobia without 
      comorbid alcohol use disorders. It has recently been shown that treatment of 
      comorbid anxiety disorders in alcohol-dependent patients can also be very 
      successful. The purpose of the present study was to find predictors of treatment 
      success for comorbid anxiety disorders in alcohol-dependent patients. METHODS: The 
      study was conducted in a sample of 34 completers with a double diagnosis of alcohol 
      dependence and agoraphobia or social phobia who received CBT for their comorbid 
      anxiety disorder in a 32-week randomized controlled trial comparing alcohol and CBT 
      anxiety disorder treatment with alcohol treatment alone. In the current report, 
      treatment success was defined as a clinically significant change (recovery) on the 
      anxiety discomfort scale. RESULTS: The severity of comorbid alcohol dependence did 
      not influence the beneficial effect of CBT on the anxiety disorder. Psychological 
      distress (SCL-90), neuroticism (NEO N), conscientiousness (NEO C), gender, 
      employment and age of onset of alcohol dependence showed some predictive value. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-dependent males with a comorbid anxiety disorder seem to 
      benefit most from CBT if their alcohol dependence started after age 25, if they are 
      employed and if their general psychopathology is less severe. The most important 
      conclusion, however, is that even severely alcohol-dependent patients with an 
      anxiety disorder can benefit from psychotherapy for their anxiety disorder.

TI  - A cognitive-behavioral intervention for emotion regulation in adults with 
      high-functioning autism spectrum disorders: study protocol for a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 231
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-14-231 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have 
      difficulties in social communication; thus, these individuals have trouble 
      understanding the mental states of others. Recent research also suggests that adults 
      with ASD are unable to understand their own mental states, which could lead to 
      difficulties in emotion-regulation. Some studies have reported the efficacy of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in improving emotion-regulation among children 
      with ASD. The current study will investigate the efficacy of group-based CBT for 
      adults with ASD. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomized, waitlist controlled, 
      single-blinded trial. The participants will be 60 adults with ASD; 30 will be 
      assigned to a CBT group and 30 to a waitlist control group. Primary outcome measures 
      are the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Coping Inventory for Stressful 
      Situations, the Motion Picture Mind-Reading task, and an ASD questionnaire. The 
      secondary outcome measures are the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
      Scale, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale 26-item version, the 
      Global Assessment of Functioning, State-trait Anxiety Inventory, Social Phobia and 
      Anxiety Inventory, and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. All will be administered 
      during the pre- and post-intervention, and 12 week follow-up periods. The CBT group 
      will receive group therapy over an 8 week period (one session per week) with each 
      session lasting approximately 100 minutes. Group therapy will consist of four or 
      five adults with ASD and two psychologists. We will be using visual materials for 
      this program, mainly the Cognitive Affective Training kit. DISCUSSION: This trial 
      will hopefully indicate the efficacy of group-based CBT for adults with high- 
      functioning ASD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in The University 
      Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry No. UMIN000006236.

LID - 10.1002/jclp.22424 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the predictive value of cognitive coping strategies at 
      pretreatment and the value of changes in these strategies during 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment for aviophobia for long-term therapy results. METHOD: 
      Data from baseline, after therapy at 2 months, short-term follow-up at 5 months, and 
      long-term follow-up at 41 months were analyzed (N = 59). RESULTS: Participants were 
      in a long-term process of change, which continued positively after therapy for 
      maladaptive cognitive coping strategies. The use of cognitive coping strategies at 
      baseline was not predictive of long-term outcome. However, a greater increase in the 
      use of adaptive coping strategies, and more importantly, a greater decrease in the 
      use of maladaptive coping strategies were predictive of improvements indicated in 
      self-report of flight anxiety and actual flight behavior at long-term follow-up. 
      CONCLUSION: Improvement of maladaptive cognitive coping strategies is possibly a key 
      mechanism of change in cognitive-behavioral therapy for aviophobia.

TI  - Group cognitive behavior therapy for Japanese patients with social anxiety disorder: 
      preliminary outcomes and their predictors.
PG  - 69
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of studies have provided strong evidence for the use of 
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in the treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD). 
      However, all of the previous reports were from Europe and North America and it is 
      unknown whether Western psychological therapies are effective for SAD in non-Western 
      cultures. The present pilot study aimed to evaluate CBT program for SAD which was 
      originally developed for Western patients, among Japanese patients. METHODS: 
      Fifty-seven outpatients who participated in group CBT for SAD were evaluated using 
      eight self-reported and one clinician-administered questionnaires to measure various 
      aspects of SAD symptomatology at the beginning and at the end of the program. Pre- 
      and post-treatment scores were compared and the magnitude of treatment effect was 
      quantified as well based once on the intention-to-treat (ITT) and once among the 
      completers only. We also examined baseline predictors of the CBT outcomes. RESULTS: 
      Seven patients (12%) did not complete the program. For the ITT sample, the 
      percentage of reduction was 20% to 30% and the pre to post treatment effect sizes 
      ranged from 0.37 to 1.01. Among the completers, the respective figures were 20% to 
      33% and 0.41 to 1.19. We found no significant pretreatment predictor of the 
      outcomes. CONCLUSION: Group CBT for SAD is acceptable and can bring about a similar 
      degree of symptom reduction among Japanese patients with SAD as among Western 
      patients.

TI  - Behavioral interventions for office-based care: stress and anxiety disorders.
PG  - 28-40
AB  - Numerous behavioral therapies have been investigated in the management of anxiety- 
      and stress-related disorders. There is strong evidence to support cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) in the management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 
      posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and 
      social phobias. Adjunctive behavioral sleep intervention may enhance results for 
      GAD, and initiation of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for GAD before CBT 
      also may enhance response. Several randomized clinical trials showed benefit of 
      Internet-based CBT for GAD, but additional studies are needed before conclusions can 
      be drawn regarding its effectiveness for posttraumatic stress disorder. Although 
      outcome data are limited, family physicians can offer patients screening for anxiety 
      disorders, psychological first aid (ie, listening to and comforting patients, 
      teaching about emotional and physiologic responses to traumatic incidents, and 
      encouraging engagement with social supports and coping) after trauma, education 
      about anxiety disorders, and referral to evidence-based self-help resources. Family 
      physicians also can ensure linkage with behavioral health care physicians and 
      encourage adherence to self-help protocols.

LID - 10.1080/08964289.2011.640364 [doi]
AB  - Prior work demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral (CBT) and supportive-experiential 
      (SET) group interventions can reduce dysfunctional fear of progression (FoP) in 
      patients with chronic diseases. In this secondary analysis of a randomized 
      controlled study, we investigated determinants of long-term response to group 
      therapy for FoP. Response to therapy after 12 months was assessed using the Reliable 
      Change Index (RCI). Outcome data were available for 129 patients with cancer and 116 
      patients with chronic arthritis. 37.9% of the patients in the CBT group and 32.7% of 
      those attending the SET group indicated response to therapy (p=.402). Educational 
      level predicted long-term response to therapy (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.33-4.81; p=.005). 
      Medical patients with lower education may need additional attention in order to gain 
      long-lasting benefit from brief group psychotherapy. However, this investigation 
      needs to be replicated in a study that includes a broader range of psychological 
      predictors.

AB  - Anxiety is common in dementia and is associated with decreased independence and 
      increased risk of nursing home placement. However, little is known about the 
      treatment of anxiety in dementia. This article reports results from two patients who 
      were treated with a modified version of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety in 
      dementia (CBT-AD). Modifications were made in the content, structure, and learning 
      strategies of CBT to adapt skills to the cognitive limitations of these patients and 
      include collaterals (i.e., family members, friends, or other caregivers) in the 
      treatment process. The patients received education and awareness training and were 
      taught the skills of diaphragmatic breathing, coping self-statements, exposure, and 
      behavioral activation. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale was used to 
      characterize dementia severity and determine eligibility for treatment (a CDR score 
      of 0.5 to 2.0 was required for participation). Other measures included the Rating 
      Anxiety in Dementia scale, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Anxiety subscale, and the 
      Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Outcome data showed improvement in 
      anxiety as measured by standardized rating scales. We conclude that CBT-AD is 
      potentially useful in treating anxiety in dementia patients and that this technique 
      merits further study.

TI  - Social anxiety disorder. A guide for primary care physicians.
PG  - 176-8
AB  - Social anxiety disorder is prevalent, potentially disabling, but quite treatable. A 
      thorough and directed history can distinguish social phobia from depression, panic 
      disorder, and OCD. It can also screen for and identify possible substance abuse. 
      Once the diagnosis is made, a combination of pharmacologic and psychotherapy is 
      indicated. The SSRIs, MAOIs, benzodiazepines, and beta-blockers--as well as CBT--can 
      effectively treat social anxiety symptoms. Primary care physicians may well want to 
      begin by prescribing an SSRI like paroxetine, along with a high potency 
      benzodiazepine to be taken on a regular or an as-needed basis, and a beta-blocker to 
      take as needed in anticipation of stressful social situations. A referral for CBT 
      should be considered. If the patient has marked side effects from drug treatment or 
      a lack of adequate response to medication, psychiatric referral is definitely 
      indicated.

AB  - We designed and pilot-tested a group-based, work-related cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (WCBT) for unemployed individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). WCBT, 
      delivered in a vocational service setting by vocational service professionals, aims 
      to reduce social anxiety and enable individuals to seek, obtain, and retain 
      employment. We compared WCBT to a vocational services as usual control condition 
      (VSAU). Participants were unemployed, homeless, largely African American, vocational 
      service-seeking adults with SAD (N = 58), randomized to receive either eight 
      sessions of WCBT plus VSAU or VSAU alone and followed three months post-treatment. 
      Multilevel modeling revealed significantly greater reductions in social anxiety, 
      general anxiety, depression, and functional impairment for WCBT compared to VSAU. 
      Coefficients for job search activity and self-efficacy indicated greater increases 
      for WCBT. Hours worked per week in the follow-up period did not differ between the 
      groups, but small sample size and challenges associated with measuring work hours 
      may have contributed to this finding. Overall, the results of this study suggest 
      that unemployed persons with SAD can be effectively treated with specialized 
      work-related CBT administered by vocational service professionals. Future testing of 
      WCBT with a larger sample, a longer follow-up period, and adequate power to assess 
      employment outcomes is warranted.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be adapted to a wide range of clinical 
      difficulties and presenting problems that face lesbians, gay men, and bisexual 
      persons. The following article presents general guidelines for and two case examples 
      of the use of CBT. The first case is a gay male struggling with social phobia. This 
      case is an example of how to adapt a structured, empirically supported 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment focusing on social phobia to situations that are 
      associated with his sexual orientation. The second is a woman struggling with 
      multiple issues including coming out. This case provides an example of how to add 
      specific cognitive-behavioral techniques to coming-out issues within the context of 
      a more eclectic, longer-term therapy.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by aberrant prefrontal activity 
      during reappraisal, an adaptive cognitive approach aimed at downregulating the 
      automatic response evoked by a negative event. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is 
      first-line psychotherapy for SAD, however, many remain symptomatic after treatment 
      indicating baseline individual differences in neurofunctional activity may factor 
      into CBT outcome. An emotion regulation strategy practiced in CBT is cognitive 
      restructuring, a proxy for reappraisal. Therefore, neural response during 
      reappraisal may serve as a brain-based predictor of CBT success. Prior to 12weeks of 
      individual CBT, 34 patients with SAD completed a validated emotion regulation task 
      during fMRI. Task instructions included 'Reappraise,' that is, use a cognitive 
      approach to reduce affective state to a negative image, which was contrasted with 
      looking at a negative image ('Look'). Regression results for Reappraise (vs. Look) 
      revealed greater reduction in symptom severity was predicted by less pre-CBT 
      activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Regarding predictive 
      validity, DLPFC significantly classified responder status. Post-hoc analysis 
      revealed DLPFC activity, but not demographic data, baseline clinical measures, or 
      reappraisal-related affective state during fMRI, significantly accounted for the 
      variance in symptom reduction. Findings indicate patients with SAD are more likely 
      to benefit from CBT if there is less pre-treatment DLPFC recruitment, a region 
      strongly implicated in emotion regulation. Patients with reduced baseline frontal 
      activation when reappraising negative stimuli may be especially helped by explicit 
      cognitive interventions. Further research is necessary to establish DLPFC as a 
      stable brain-based marker of treatment outcome.

AB  - The use of D-cycloserine (DCS) as a cognitive enhancer to augment exposure-based 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) represents a promising new translational research 
      direction with the goal to accelerate and optimize treatment response for anxiety 
      disorders. Some studies suggest that DCS may not only augment extinction learning 
      but could also facilitate fear memory reconsolidation. Therefore, the effect of DCS 
      may depend on fear levels reported at the end of exposure sessions. This paper 
      presents the rationale and design for a randomized controlled trial examining the 
      relative efficacy of tailoring DCS administration based on exposure success (i.e. 
      end fear levels) during a 5-session group CBT protocol for social anxiety disorder 
      (n = 156). Specifically, tailored post-session DCS administration will be compared 
      against untailored post-session DCS, untailored pre-session DCS, and pill placebo in 
      terms of reduction in social anxiety symptoms and responder status. In addition, a 
      subset of participants (n = 96) will undergo a fear extinction retention experiment 
      prior to the clinical trial in which they will be randomly assigned to receive 
      either DCS or placebo prior to extinguishing a conditioned fear. The results from 
      this experimental paradigm will clarify the mechanism of the effects of DCS on 
      exposure procedures. This study aims to serve as the first step toward developing an 
      algorithm for the personalized use of DCS during CBT for social anxiety disorder, 
      with the ultimate goal of optimizing treatment outcome for anxiety disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The evidence for the efficacy of D-cycloserine (DCS) for augmenting 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders has been mixed. Guided by 
      preclinical research and initial findings from a small-scale study involving humans, 
      we tested the hypothesis that DCS enhancement of exposure therapy would be specific 
      to successful exposure sessions. METHOD: Medication-free adults with generalized 
      social anxiety disorder (N = 145) received 50 mg of DCS or placebo 1 h before each 
      of 5 exposure sessions that were part of a standardized 12-session group CBT 
      protocol. Participants provided fear ratings at the beginning and just before the 
      end of exposure exercises. Independent raters, blind to group assignment, 
      administered the clinical global impression improvement and severity scales at each 
      session and at posttreatment. RESULTS: Mixed-effects analyses revealed that, among 
      patients who reported low fear at the end of an exposure session, those who had 
      received DCS evidenced significantly greater clinical improvement at the next 
      session, relative to those who had received placebo. In contrast, when exposure end 
      fear was high, patients receiving DCS exhibited less clinical improvement at the 
      following session than patients receiving placebo. Similarly, patients who had 
      received DCS evidenced lower clinical severity at posttreatment, relative to 
      patients who had received placebo, only when their average end fear for 
      medication-augmented sessions had been in the low to moderate range. Finally, these 
      moderating effects of exposure success as indexed by end fear were not better 
      accounted for by within-session extinction. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of DCS for 
      augmenting exposure-based CBT depends on the success of exposure sessions. These 
      findings may help guide the development of an algorithm for the effective use of DCS 
      for augmenting exposure-based CBT. TRIAL REGISTRY: http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov,

TI  - Group cognitive behavioral therapy for patients with generalized social anxiety 
      disorder in Japan: outcomes at 1-year follow up and outcome predictors.
PG  - 267-75
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S41365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common psychiatric 
      disorders worldwide. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment 
      option for patients with SAD. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of 
      group CBT for patients with generalized SAD in Japan at 1-year follow-up and 
      investigated predictors with regard to outcomes. METHODS: This study was conducted 
      as a single-arm, naturalistic, follow-up study in a routine Japanese clinical 
      setting. A total of 113 outpatients with generalized SAD participated in group CBT 
      from July 2003 to August 2010 and were assessed at follow-ups for up to 1 year. 
      Primary outcome was the total score on the Social Phobia Scale/Social Interaction 
      Anxiety Scale (SPS/SIAS) at 1 year. Possible baseline predictors were investigated 
      using mixed-model analyses. RESULTS: Among the 113 patients, 70 completed the 
      assessment at the 1-year follow-up. The SPS/SIAS scores showed significant 
      improvement throughout the follow-ups for up to 1 year. The effect sizes of SPS/SIAS 
      at the 1-year follow-up were 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.95)/0.76 
      (0.49-1.03) in the intention-to-treat group and 0.77 (0.42-1.10)/0.84 (0.49-1.18) in 
      completers. Older age at baseline, late onset, and lower severity of SAD were 
      significantly associated with good outcomes as a result of mixed-model analyses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CBT for patients with generalized SAD in Japan is effective for up to 1 
      year after treatment. The effect sizes were as large as those in previous studies 
      conducted in Western countries. Older age at baseline, late onset, and lower 
      severity of SAD were predictors for a good outcome from group CBT.

TI  - Treatment of nulliparous women with severe fear of childbirth via the Internet: a 
      feasibility study.
PG  - 37-43
LID - 10.3109/0167482X.2016.1140143 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to test the feasibility of Internet 
      interventions among nulliparous women suffering from severe fear of childbirth (FOC) 
      by means of an Internet-delivered therapist-supported self-help program based on 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. 
      SETTING: A feasibility study of an ICBT program for the treatment of severe FOC in 
      pregnant women. SAMPLE: Twenty-eight Swedish-speaking nulliparous women with severe 
      FOC recruited via a project home page from January 2012 to December 2013. METHODS: 
      The main components of the ICBT program for the treatment of severe FOC comprised 
      psycho-education, breathing retraining, cognitive restructuring, imaginary exposure, 
      in vivo exposure and relapse prevention. The study participants were anonymously 
      self-recruited over the Internet, interviewed by telephone and then enrolled. All 
      participants were offered 8 weeks of treatment via the Internet. Participants 
      reported their homework weekly, submitted measurements of their fear and received 
      feedback from a therapist via a secure online contact management system. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Level of FOC measured with the Wijma Delivery 
      Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ A) during screening at enrollment and 
      weekly during the treatment (W-DEQ version A), and after the delivery (W-DEQ version 
      B). RESULTS: A statistically significant (p < 0.0005) decrease of FOC [W-DEQ sum 
      score decreased pre to post-therapy, with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.95)]. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this feasibility study suggest that ICBT has potential 
      in the treatment of severe FOC during pregnancy in motivated nulliparous women. The 
      results need to be confirmed by randomized controlled studies.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy delays relapse in female socially phobic alcoholics.
PG  - 333-45
AB  - The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that socially phobic 
      alcoholics treated with Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT) will have better drinking 
      outcomes than those treated with Twelve-Step Facilitation therapy (TSF). Three 
      hundred ninety-seven treatment-seeking alcoholics with concurrent social phobia were 
      compared retrospectively to a matched sample of 397 alcoholics without social 
      phobia. Treatment was delivered in an outpatient setting, and patients were 
      randomized to either CBT, TSF, or Motivational Enhancement therapy (MET). The groups 
      were compared on self-reported drinking measures (e.g., quantity and frequency of 
      drinking, and time-to-event measures) during treatment period and monthly for 1 year 
      following treatment. Survival analyses revealed that female outpatients with social 
      phobia showed delayed relapse to drinking when treated with CBT rather than TSF; the 
      reverse was true for female outpatients without social phobia. Survival analyses in 
      male outpatients with and without social phobia revealed an opposite trend, though 
      it was not statistically significant. These data suggest that Cognitive Behavioral 
      therapy is superior to Twelve-Step Facilitation therapy for the treatment of alcohol 
      problems in specific populations. namely socially phobic women seeking outpatient 
      treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for 
      panic disorder, but many fewer patients receive this treatment compared to 
      medication-based therapy. Mobile app-based interactive CBT using a chatbot can 
      increase patient access to CBT. We performed a preliminary study to determine 
      whether short-term use of a newly developed chatbot is feasible and effective for 
      relieving panic symptoms. METHOD: Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to 
      either a chatbot group (n = 21) or control group (n = 20) for a period of 4 weeks. 
      The chatbot group was guided in the use of the chatbot application, while the 
      control group was provided with a book on panic disorder. MAIN RESULTS: The severity 
      of panic disorder was significantly decreased in the chatbot group, but not in the 
      control group. The social phobia score was significantly decreased and the control 
      helplessness score was significantly increased in the chatbot group compared to the 
      control group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We found that mobile app-based interactive 
      CBT using the chatbot was feasible and effective for reducing the severity of panic 
      symptoms. Using this novel approach to provide CBT would allow clinicians to effect 
      positive therapeutic outcomes with easy accessibility, interactivity, and 
      self-management for patients with panic symptoms.

TI  - A randomized, controlled trial of the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      and sertraline versus a waitlist control group for anxiety disorders in older 
      adults.
PG  - 255-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is the first to investigate the relative effectiveness of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with a selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline) in a randomized, controlled trial on the treatment of 
      anxiety disorders in older adults. METHOD: Eighty-four patients 60 years of age and 
      over with a principal diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, 
      agoraphobia, or social phobia were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 15 
      sessions of CBT, pharmacologic treatment with an SSRI (sertraline; maximum dosage 
      150 mg), or a waitlist control group. Participants completed measures of primary 
      outcome (anxiety) and coexistent worry and depressive symptoms at baseline, 
      posttreatment, and at three-month follow up. RESULTS: Attrition rates were high in 
      both treatment groups. Consequently, findings are based on a relatively small sample 
      of completers (N = 52). Although both CBT and sertraline led to significant 
      improvement in anxiety, worry, and depressive symptoms both at posttreatment and at 
      three-month follow up, sertraline showed superior results on worry symptoms. Effect 
      size estimates for CBT were in the small to medium range both at posttreatment (mean 
      d = 0.42) and at three-month follow up (mean d = 0.35), whereas effect sizes for 
      sertraline fell into the large range (posttreatment mean d = 0.94 and three-month 
      follow up mean d = 1.02). The waitlist condition showed virtually no effects 
      (posttreatment mean d = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly suggest that the 
      pharmacologic treatment of late-life anxiety with SSRIs has not been given the 
      proper attention in research to date.

TI  - Synchronous change in subjective and physiological reactivity during flight as an 
      indicator of treatment outcome for aviophobia: A longitudinal study with 3-year 
      follow-up.

LID - S0005-7916(18)30103-4 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Emotion can be seen as the organizing process that 
      coordinates response systems to deal effectively with challenges and opportunities. 
      Synchronous change in subjective and physiological reactivity is regarded as an 
      indication of this organizing process. Synchrony is expected to increase with the 
      intensity of emotional stimuli. Conversely, adaptive emotional functioning could be 
      indicated by progressive synchrony upon increasing demands, and the magnitude of 
      synchrony could be an indication of progress during therapy. METHODS: We examined 
      whether synchronous change in subjective and physiological reactivity over repeated 
      exposures increased from watching a flight video through simulated flight to actual 
      flight, and whether the magnitude of synchronous change predicted favourable short- 
      and long-term treatment outcome within a group of 77 aviophobic participants during 
      CBT. RESULTS: Results did not show a relationship between the intensity of the 
      phobic stimuli and the magnitude of synchronous change in subjective and 
      physiological reactivity. Moreover, synchronous change across both response systems 
      did not predict treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS: By design this study had no control 
      group. Additional treatment or life events between end of treatment and 3-year 
      follow-up were not assessed. CONCLUSION: The results provide only weak support for 
      the functionalistic view that successful treatment of anxiety disorders is indicated 
      by synchronous change in reactivity across emotional response systems. The 
      relationship between these systems is likely to be affected by many intervening 
      variables including higher order cognitive processes.

TI  - One-year follow-up of pharmacotherapy-resistant patients with panic disorder treated 
      with cognitive-behavior therapy: Outcome and predictors of remission.
PG  - 657-65
AB  - Non-response to pharmacotherapy for panic disorder (PD) is a well-documented 
      problem. However, little information exists to guide next-step strategies for these 
      non-responders. In addition to pharmacologic augmentation strategies, several 
      studies support the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for these patients, 
      although data on long-term outcomes has been lacking. In this study, we provide 
      one-year outcomes on a sample of 63 patients who completed group CBT for PD after 
      failing to respond adequately to previous pharmacotherapy. Sustained significant 
      benefit was found for all dimensional outcome scores, and nearly two-thirds of the 
      sample met remission criteria. This occurred with reductions in medication use over 
      the follow-up period. Negative predictors of remission status included comorbid 
      dysthymia, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. These results provide 
      additional evidence for the efficacy of CBT for medication non-responders with PD.

TI  - The revised version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders 
      (SCARED-R): treatment sensitivity in an early intervention trial for childhood 
      anxiety disorders.
PG  - 323-36
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The revised version of the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related 
      Emotional Disorders (SCARED-R) is a recently developed self-report questionnaire for 
      measuring DSM-IV defined anxiety disorder symptoms in children. The current study 
      examined the treatment sensitivity of the SCARED-R. METHODS: Thirty-six children 
      (aged 8-13 years) who fulfilled the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, 
      separation anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia received either group or 
      individual cognitive-behavioural treatment. Children completed the SCARED-R and a 
      traditional measure of childhood anxiety, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for 
      Children (STAIC), at three points in time: (1) 6 months before treatment (i.e. 
      baseline), (2) pre-treatment, and (3) post-treatment. RESULTS: Results showed that 
      children's SCARED-R and STAIC scores did not change from baseline to pre-treatment, 
      but significantly declined from pre-treatment to post-treatment. An additional 
      finding of the present study was that group and individual CBT were equally 
      effective in reducing children's anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded 
      that the SCARED-R reliably taps treatment effects and thus should be regarded as a 
      useful self-report index of childhood anxiety in clinical and research settings. 
      Furthermore, the data support the notion that CBT should be generally regarded as an 
      efficacious intervention for anxiety disordered children.

      for panic disorder.
PG  - 548-55
LID - 10.1097/NMD.0b013e31817cf6f7 [doi]
AB  - A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Barlow et al., 2000 JAMA. 
      283:2529-2536) examined separate and synergistic effects of psychological and 
      pharmacological treatments for panic disorder. One finding warranting further 
      investigation involved relatively high relapse rates of participants who received 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) + imipramine when compared with those receiving 
      CBT + placebo. In this article, we investigate why CBT was less effective in 
      protecting against relapse for individuals in the active drug condition. We 
      hypothesized that participants correctly deduced treatment assignments and, for 
      those taking imipramine, this was associated with the belief that they were no 
      longer taking active drug after discontinuation, accounting for increased relapse 
      rates. Contrary to hypothesis, there were no group differences in frequencies of 
      guessing drug or placebo, nor were specific beliefs about taking drug or placebo 
      differentially associated with relapse. Other possible reasons for differential 
      relapse rates and treatment implications are discussed.

AB  - Claustrophobia, this fear of being locked up without being able to escape, affects 
      about 4 to 5% of subjects in the general population. For some years, studies tackle 
      this trouble in the context of medical exam and treatments (MRI, radiotherapy, 
      etc.). Studies show that cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) obtain satisfying 
      results for treating such patients. Here, we present a case report of a CBT 
      intervention for a patient suffering from a cancer and whose claustrophobia impeded 
      her treatment.

AB  - The present study aimed to examine how video feedback can affect perceived 
      performance and anticipatory anxiety in various naturalistic social 
      anxiety-provoking situations among clinical patients diagnosed with social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD) and to examine predictors that might influence response to video 
      feedback. Participants were 52 consecutive patients with DSM-IV SAD who participated 
      in a group-based CBT program. Our results demonstrated that video feedback was 
      associated with a decrease in the underestimation of own performance as well as the 
      perception of feared outcomes. Moreover, anticipatory anxiety decreased after video 
      feedback combined with peer feedback. Male sex, comorbidity with other anxiety 
      disorders, and benzodiazepine prn, as well as patients' initial anxiety and 
      avoidance were negative predictors of the effect of video feedback.
