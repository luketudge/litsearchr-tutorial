# A tutorial for litsearchr

The R package `litsearchr` provides various functions to help with planning a systematic search of the scientific literature on a given topic. This short tutorial gives an example of how to use `litsearchr`, along with some brief explanations of its workings. `litsearchr` was created by the amazing [Eliza Grames](https://elizagrames.github.io), and a lot of this tutorial is an elaboration of the existing [vignette](https://elizagrames.github.io/litsearchr/litsearchr_vignette_v041.html) for the package.
